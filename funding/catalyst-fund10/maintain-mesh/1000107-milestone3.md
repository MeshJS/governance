Additional a new repository for on Mesh PBL Student library on github has been setup https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl-student-library 

While the PBL is live, we receive feedback & insights to further improve and develop the PBL. 

Well engaged and moderated Discord channels

The MeshJS Discord server is constantly maintained and active, main activity has shifted to the public channels at the #ask-team and #chill-here channels. Interesting to observe that we opened multiple new private Discord channels where individuals are added around specific topics. The private channels allow more focused coordination and work on specific topics. In parallel, we also maintain a public Mesh PBL channel on the Gimbalabs Discord server.
