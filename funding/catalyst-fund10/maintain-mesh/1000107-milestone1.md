## Milestone 1 Report
URGENT TO READ DEAR REVIEWER.
Our last (already updated) PoA got rejected without any need. The Reviewer stated:

"If there are bi-weekly recorded sesions then I am presuming the number of recorded links you are sending to us, should be more than 3, kindly work on this.
Also there's no proof for team formation, with their roles, nor a kanban board showing your project management, kindly work on these and revert thanks"

Re bi-weekly session: 
You are aware that this is Milestone 1 which covers solely a fix amount of Live Coding session. Your assumption that there should be more than 3 makes no sense. As mentioned, all live coding sessions for this Milestone as well as the Playground updates have been successfully completed.

Re: No proof of team formation, nor a Kanban board showing project management:
Dear reviewer. You clearly did not read our PoA as everything you ask for is already included. Please CHECK THE PROVIDED links.
