## Milestone 2 Report

Thank you for taking the time to review our Proof Of Achievement for Milestone 2. We are glad to report that all envisioned outcomes have been achieved. 

Our envisioned Milestones deliverables had been stated in our Milestone acceptance criteria as:

Onboarded and engaged Developer Community on MeshJS PBL via Andamio Platform which actively participate in Courses (Modules, Lessons)
Created & Published educational materials via Andamio & MeshJS Social Media accounts
Lively and active developer community on the MeshJS Discord
Announced, Hosted & Recorded Live Playground Session
Here is how we executed on each deliverable:

Onboarded and engaged Developer Community on MeshJS PBL via Andamio Platform which actively participate in Courses (Modules, Lessons)
The MeshJS PBL is publicly available at https://pbl.meshjs.dev/course/mesh and at our github for contributors and builders: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl. 

For detailed insights on all created modules, lessons, SLTs etc.

https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl/tree/main/src/andamio/course 

We have an actively engaged group of community members who participate and contribute to the course creation and who organise and coordinate their contributions on their own private discord channel on the MeshJS Discord server, currently including 14 individuals which engage though direct course content on github as well as in recurring team meetings and open live events.

Created & Published educational materials via Andamio & MeshJS Social Media accounts
Educational material such as videos, text content etc, have been directly implemented into the MeshPBL and accessible through the course itself. You can open lessons to check the content.

In addition we decided to use mainly the Gimbalabs social media account to share . Regular tweets as well as live streams of live coding sessions and playgrounds are distributed on X(Twitter) as the main platform for outreach.

Here some overview of such tweets

Lively and active developer community on the MeshJS Discord
As mentioned earlier, we are happy to see a group of 14 individuals who joined in creating the PBL and who organise and coordinate together on a private channel on the MeshJS Discord server.

General community management on the MeshJS Discord has been active without any interruptions. We have a likely and supportive Discord and made some great experiences where newcomers get engaged, start to build their own projects and sometimes even become core contributors themself. This Proposal itself is the best example as we started with initial 3 contributors and grew into a group of 14 individuals. 

Additional discord communications on the MeshPBL take place on the Gimbalabs Discord server with its own mesh-pbl channel which is moderated by Gimbalabs:

Announced, Hosted & Recorded Live Playground Session
The Gimbalabs Playground sessions are as usual taking place on a weekly basis and aren't recorded mainly on Youtube anymore but on Twitter (X) where they are regularly announced and recorded directly on Twitter.

You can find the announcements of Mesh live coding session and Playground session on the Gimbalabs twitter account at:

Some Challenges we faced.

We do not only want to report on the success of the proposal, but also on the difficulties and on the failures and challenges we encountered along this proposal implementation. This is mainly to help others to learn from our mistakes and challenges and to be open on things which should be. Ideally, this part also provides some important context and insights on the overall proposal. :) 

1) Keeping Scope

When the proposal was submitted, we didn't think about running everything through a PBL, the main idea was to keep a rather less structured framework and mostly focus on discord, event and bounty engagements. By changing the proposals scope to a PBL we first needed to introduce the Project-Based-Learning methodology to contributors as the educational framework requires very specific processes and content creation to which we needed to adapt our initial operations. 

While PBLs can provide highly effective and innovative solutions for developer education, there is a challenge in building first hand the required knowledge and capacity to effectively create and launch a PBL.

A learning and recommendation for anyone interested in operating a PBL would be to allocate sufficient resources and time to a PBL initial setup before directly focusing on the launch. Make sure you have the time to get your contributors well informed on what a PBL is and how it could work for your project. This may, depending on the size of your team, take up to 3 months. 

A Major risk here is the missing financial support when not carefully calculating on that required time. More on that at 3) Regular Funding & Adjustability.

2) Measuring Impact

From the perspective of engaging newcomers to use our tools and to build projects on Cardano, it is mostly difficult to track the direct impact which a project like MeshJS adds to the wider Cardano Ecosystem which then makes it difficult to legitimise fund requests. We see the need to explore and establish effective impact-measurements which make it easy for everyone to understand the impact which we bring to the cardano developer ecosystem. We don't know which solutions may apply, nor do we have the time aor capacity to jump on that, and well, guess we aren't experts on that either. So we need to find someone for the MeshJS team itself, or it could be rather a solution provided by someone else. But yeah, as you see, we don't have any strong or clear perspective on that yet and simply identify that it is a major challenge for us and maybe for many others as well.

3) Regular Funding & Adjustability

Based on the fact that we changed the scope to a PBL, we transformed the initial proposal into milestones which fully relied on the PBL development while not foreseeing the time which was needed to get everyone into the PBL framework. This adjustment threw us in a heavy delay regarding the envisioned delivery dates while in the meantime everyone has been highly engaged. This causes a situation where we haven't been able to actually reward this much additional required time from everyone and now, after starting the Proposal in October 2023, we finally can close our second milestone which was initially planned to be closed in November 2023. Yet we received only the first funding batch of the first Milestone as we planned to deliver on the milestones on a monthly basis.. Well as you know, we have not foreseen the required time needed to adapt the proposal to the PBL and forced ourselves into a situation where we had to ensure high quality engagement at the PBL creation from a growing number of contributors without having strong financial rewards actually available. So, we kinda really messed up on that regard and it is important for anyone to learn from this issue so that they don't do the same mistake as we did ðŸ™‚
Tho, an interesting question we can ask ourselves is:
If we actually had to create the whole PBL with only one Milestone funding, how did we achieve that actually ? oOâ€¦ maybe there are different kinds of incentives which are important in a project like MeshJS. 
We are heavily committed to open source and grass root developer ecosystems where anyone who wants can jump in and learn and contribute. Most of our activities are not paid and we are often used to doing what we do as a service to the Cardano Ecosystem as whole, and it's here where our real commitment lives, drives and ensures our ongoing activities. Meaning for you, if you are an open source and open project where newcomers can join and step up their game, then you may have the secret sauce which allows you to overcome financial challenges with much more ease and with a growing resilience which makes you survive and build even in the most challenging times. 

4) Unexpected outcomes

Sometimes, the best things which happen aren't the ones you planned. 
That's definitely true in our case and one beautiful things we saw and see happening is that the Mesh PBL became a project bringing together multiple projects and contributors from different communities. In our case, MeshJS and the Mesh PBL brought together:

Gimbalabs
Sidan Labs
Andamio

This collaboration led to multiple spin off initiatives and initiated a strongly aligned movement and coordinations of these projects. Interestingly, the naturally shared values are in the very same spirit as this proposal, engage, enable and grow the Cardano Open Source Developer Ecosystem. This collaboration constantly evolves and matures and might lead to interesting outcomes. Will report on that evolution in further Milestone reports.

And thats it, enough for this report.

Thanks a lot for taking your time and reading through everything, thanks for everyone who voted for us to make this thing become real and thanks for all the supporters and contributors.
