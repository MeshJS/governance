Project KPIs
Increase open-source project visibility
The visibility of Mesh greatly improved over time, and we see a constant growth of now several
hundred Builders using Mesh to build their own projects.
Check our github where you can find a list of all repositories which are using mesh:
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents
Further insights on mesh usage can be found via:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@meshsdk/core
Since mesh covers a lot of different areas for developers building on Cardano and is not limited
to one specific area we have an advantage that the nature of projects who are using mesh is
quite diverse, from tx builder, to wallet or smart contracts, we have a bit for everything which
helps us to ensure a broad use of our open source tech stack. This helps our visibility greatly as
we don't have to market our work on twitter, but rather by pushing great tools to happy users,
and well, a happy user is the best thing one can have since it is likely that a happy user also
recommends you to others.
Improve documentation
Updating & maintaining our documentation has been a constant focus at mesh and has since its
beginning greatly grown and improved. You can find our docs at https://docs.meshjs.dev
Adopt frameworks
Adopting frameworks, integrating and harmonising mesh tooling with cardano tech stack is a top
priority for us and the mesh sdk receives constant updates and new features to keep our tech
stack compatible and easy to use.
These efforts are often a challenge, especially in a decentralised ecosystem full of ambitious
builders who constantly come up with new innovations all over the place, keeping track and
catching up with updates is an effort which should not be underestimated.

Well-documented projects
Providing project specific documentation is pretty helpful for developers, especially new ones in
the space. We give a heavy focus on projects, including their documentation, directly accessible
via the Mesh website home page at: https://meshjs.dev/
We focus on actionable content, with the goal to take as much complexity off as possible and to
have our documentation on projects as usable as possible, lowering barriers and needed time
for developers when building on projects.
Well-documented examples and guides
In addition to general docs as well as project-specific documentation, we also provide a set of
guides and examples for developers to take inspiration from and build upon.

Key Achievements
General
As a dedicated open-source project to the Cardano Ecosystem, the main achievement of this
proposal has been to explore and battle-proof how our collective cardano treasury can
effectively support the cardano open source developer ecosystem. The funds from the proposal
help and support (and definitely motivates) us to ensure well updated and maintained open
source tooling & libraries for Cardano builders. We positioned Mesh as one of Cardano’s most
active developer projects.. We are a little proud about that tbh. We arrived to establish a highly
experienced and committed developer-community in and around Mesh and our efforts help
other builders on their developer journey at the Cardano Ecosystem. We have built a solid and
great network of committed collaborations and partnership with other developer projects and
communities and eventually, we built a strong foundation from which we can surely expect some
great things to emerge.
Bounty/Task managements
Our efforts in exploring and using bounty/task based processes to allow effective workflows and
management of open source projects has led to a ongoing thought and design process on our
side. The latest evolution on that can be followed on:
https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/projects/1/views/1
The experiences and expertise gained in organising builders around a specific project can be
best highlighted by the strong number of contributors at our core repository on Github which has
a current amount of 26 individual contributors:
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/graphs/contributors
Tho, besides the github - workflow to manage bounties/tasks which is able to cover a lot, we
also experienced that additional communication hubs on Discord with dedicated private
channels for contributors around specific areas and tropics as well as public help-channels for
builders are insanely valuable. Direct and public communication between contributors and
administrators helps a lot to effectively provide support and guidance for builders seeking a
helping hand, it also helps the administrators to stay grounded and to always know about the
builders struggles which makes out tools and solutions highly authentic and tailored to real
issues.
Online Events - Live Coding sessions
In addition to the already mentioned github and discord, we definitely experienced additional live
coding sessions where experienced builders engage in online live events with other developers
as a very valuable thing to have since it allows spaces for builders to better meet and connect,

at times to put names to faces and in the best cases, spaces where relations are being built.
Github and Discord are awesome platforms, yet, live online events indeed help to add a human
touch to everything and complements a nice set of different online sync and async tools to allow
a strong and constantly growing engagement from contributors to an open source project. We
hope that these learning may be valuable and helpful for other open source projects building in
the space.
In total, over the time frame of this proposal, we hosted 11 live - coding sessions. You can find
all recordings available at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCCIAmutGEbd5V3deH6wE1C_yMePvqsGy
Another good learning and achievement is as well that the live-coding sessions have been
hosted by our close friends at Gimbalabs and not inhouse at Mesh. Since mesh has less
capacity in organising and hosting such sessions, the collaboration with Gimbalabs was great
since their strong focus and experience on engaging community around builder projects brought
in a lot of new capacities which we could never execute with Mesh alone, in the other way
around, introducing mesh to the builders community at Gimbalabs gives them powerful tools
which will be helpful on their builders journey.
Collaborations

Collaborate closely with other Open source developer projects
SIDAN | https://www.sidan.io/
SIDAN Lab became over time a core contributor at developments and maintenance. Fair to say
that our code is written in large parts from minds at SIDAN Lab who are constantly contributing
to the evolution of Mesh.
Andamio | https://www.andamio.io/
Has been since inception a very close friend to Mesh, as many Mesh contributors are as well
deeply engaged with Andamio. Our work at the Mesh PBL wouldn't have been possible without
the support and help from the Andamio crew and we are glad to see that mesh also contributes
and supports Andamio at core developments.
Gimbalabs | https://gimbalabs.com/gimbalgrid
Gimbalabs, as one of the first open developer communities, have been a great example not only
for us but also to many others. Gimbalab's efforts in organising Playground and live coding
sessions have been a great help & support and we continue to work close with the builders at
Gimbalabs

The PBL
The Mesh - Project Based Learning course has been built and launched at
https://app.andamio.io/course/mesh.
We had a total of 42 minted contributor tokens at the Mesh PBL, which can be verified on chain
at:
https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/2338f623197e6db983612da0a74baeac62ffd693d45
4785108c26b5f .
In total, we have 8 modules and 34 lessons on which learners can test and learn their
knowledge.
Respective resources on our github can be found at:
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl-course-content
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl-student-library

The PBL which has been built using Andamio adds additional support and value to github,
discord and live events and we gained a lot of helpful experiences which led to many decisions
along the way on how we want to engage with contributors. Developing a PBL played out to be
a highly valuable experience for us as a team, as it forced us to think about a wide range of
principles and approaches on how to deal with decentralised contributor communities around
open source projects.
Key Learnings

Key learnings from this proposal can be best summarised in:
1. Developer-Centric Growth Drives Visibility
Mesh has grown its visibility organically by mainly focusing on developer needs across a wide
range of use cases. Instead of relying on marketing, we gain traction through high-quality tools,
active community engagement, and happy users who promote the project through word of
mouth.
2. Strong Documentation and Learning Resources Lower Barriers
Continuous investment in accessible, well-structured documentation, project-based learning
(PBL), examples, and live sessions significantly reduces complexity for new developers. This
approach improves onboarding, accelerates adoption, and helps developers build more
confidently within the Cardano ecosystem. Eventually improving the developer experience.
3. Collaborative Infrastructure Strengthens Open Source Sustainability

By working closely with projects like SIDAN, Andamio, and Gimbalabs, and combining
structured task/bounty workflows on GitHub with both public and private Discord channels and
regular live events, explore a effective small multi-channel ecosystem, well tailored and suited
for a open source project who wants to build a active developer community.

Next Steps
We will continue to further evolve and develop mesh open source tooling.
We have a high stake and interest in keeping Mesh alive and evolving. Yet, as many other
open source projects it is a challenge to ensure that open source code is freely available,
without being out behind a paywall and to drive revenue to sustain the open source
maintenance. Our approach is to submit regular proposals to fund and sustain Mesh open
source stack and we have approved proposals which succeed this proposal in further Catalyst
Funding rounds through which we continue and improve mesh maintenance, you can find the
maintain mesh proposals in F11, F12, F13 at:
Fund11: https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1100271
Fund12: https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200220
Fund13: https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1300130

For the long term, we think about submitting yearly maintain-mesh proposals directly at the
Cardano Treasury instead of proposals at Project Catalyst once the onchain governance
matured and allowed proposals directly to the DReps and CC.
Further, we actively explore alternative funding sources within and outside the Cardano
ecosystem since we want to build a more sustainable funding income for our open source
projects and to not rely on one single funding source such as the Cardano Treasury via
Catalyst, Intersect or direct proposals.
Our long term goal is to not only drive active use and adoption of the ecosystem, but also to
generate income and resources from outside the Cardano ecosystem while staying authentic
and loyal to our mission and the Cardano vision in general.
Will be a long run, but we hare here for it and not lazy. Expect us ^^
Final Thoughts
As an initially funded proposal, it was a great experience to see how our ecosystem enables us
and others to build tooling to enhance the growth of the cardano ecosystem. We deeply thank
everyone who participated in this proposal, from ideation to submission, to voting and finally to
the execution and completion. Also thanks to everyone at Catalyst, funding operators as well as
Milestone reviewers.
