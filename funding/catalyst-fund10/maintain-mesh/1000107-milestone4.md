## Milestone 4 Report

Hey there üôÇ

Here we are, reporting the completion of our 4th milestone which is not that fancy actually as it mainly focuses on the maintenance of our services.

The Milestone outputs have been stated as following:

Lively and active developer Community on MeshJS Discord
MeshJS Core team & Developer Community engagements on Code maintenance, bug fixing and new features & Guides development on MeshJS Andamio Instance and Github
Announced, Hosted & Recorded Live Playground Session
Github issues, coming from the community within the timeframe of this project, will be considered and an answer will be provided by the Proposal Team
And here how we progress on each of the topics:

Discord

The MeshJS Discord remains an active and productive community hub. As noted in earlier Milestone reports, the primary traffic has shifted from public general channels to specific private channels. Notably, there are now channels dedicated to specific topics across multiple servers, including MeshJS, SIDAN Lab, and Gimbalabs. These private channels are most effective when used in a timely and dynamic manner; once a topic is resolved, the need for the channel typically ends, and new channels emerge for new topics. We are observing increased direct coordination and collaboration between MeshJS, SIDAN Lab, and Gimbalabs channels, which is a good indicator of success. Previously, there was minimal coordination across managing communities on similar topics across different projects, but now we observe a growing trend in such coordination

Github Engagements & Issues

The MeshJS open source repositories on github are as usual well maintained and accessible via MeshJS Github and new issues from contributors are getting resolved and implemented.
https://github.com/MeshJS 

Here some overview on activities at the currently most actively developed repositories on MeshJs. 

Mesh repository
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/pulse/monthly 

Excluding merges, 3 authors have pushed 1 commit to main and 6 commits to all branches. On main, 1 file has changed and there have been 4 additions and 2 deletions.

Mesh Core repository
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-core/pulse/monthly 

Excluding merges, 2 authors have pushed 6 commits to main and 6 commits to all branches. On main, 12 files have changed and there have been 135 additions and 41 deletions.

Additional insights can be gained from the individual github accounts of contributors

- Jingles: https://github.com/jinglescode 
- Abdel: https://github.com/abdelkrimdev 
- Hinson: https://github.com/HinsonSIDAN 
- James: https://github.com/workshop-maybe 
- Twwu: https://github.com/twwu123 
- Roberto: https://github.com/rober-m?tab=repositories 

You can as well easily audit and find out yourself when accessing a repository, from there go to ‚Äúinsights‚Äù, from there go to ‚Äúcontributors‚Äù. :)

In addition, there are currently multiple new repos in full progress  as well which will be released once representable and usable to the community. We keep busy ^^

Live Playground Sessions

As we changed already at earlier milestones into the Live Coding sessions instead of the Playground sessions and the PBL is finalised with Milestone 3, we are now in no need for the live sessions anymore and work can focus on Discord channels and via the PBL itself. Based on the experiences on the Live coding & playground sessions through the proposal, we aim to reflect on which formats worked well and how to improve further live events for our growing developer community. 

However, executed and recorded session stay publicly available on Gimbalabs Youtube at:

Additional notes:

At the time of writing this report, the voting results of Catalyst Fund 12 have been announced and we are happy that our Fund 12 continuation of this proposal got approved. That's awesome, And as we learn and interact, we also aim to improve everything. More on the final reflections on this proposal at the next and last milestone will outline further learnings and observations which we take from this Fund 10 proposal into the Fund 12 continuation üôÇ

So, that's it for this Milestone.

We hope that he provided information satisfies the Milestone reviewer as well as voters who may want to check on our progress.

Thanks a lot everyone helping us to build and maintain MeshJS.

In service to the Cardano Ecosystem
