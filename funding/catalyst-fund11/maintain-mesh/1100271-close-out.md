E. List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them
The Challenge KPIs have been:
standardize, develop, support, or provide utilities for full stack solutions and integrated development environments, 
create new libraries, SDKs, publicly available APIs, toolchains and frameworks. 

We adresses the challenge by updating and maintaining the Mesh open source tech stack which includes a diverse set of tools & libraries.

F. List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

Our projects KPIs, aligned to the challenge KPIs have been stated as:
Speed up development on any core Cardano updates, including hard fork (Voltaire governance action), CIP updates, Hydra transaction building.
Speed up ecosystem integration in different aspects, including on-chain code building libraries (e.g. Aiken), node service (e.g. Maestro, Blockfrost, Koios).
Reduce dApps downtime when dependencies introduce breaking changes, such as node service endpoint changes.

We addressed these challenges by constantly updating and maintaining Mesh Tech Stack to the overall Cardano development, e.g updating tools to Cardano HardforK events, ensuring that existing tools can be continuously used by builders without disruption. 

G. Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)
Key achievements around collaborations have been namely with SIDAN, Andamio & Gimbalabs, with which we maintain active collaborations on the development of new features. We arrived to build a strongly aligned network of collaborators in which everyone benefits from each other's efforts. Open source makes it easy & possible to effectively work on common solutions for challenges each of the projects has to pass through.

H. Key learnings
The Maintain & Sustain Mesh proposals, approved in Catalyst Fund 10, Fund 11 and Fund 12 are really effective in motivating and supporting the ongoing maintenance and updates of the Mesh - Cardano open source tech stack. From our side, its great to see that voters and builders see the value of our work, and allow us to receive funds to keep things going.

I. Next steps for the product or service developed
With Governance in full swing, we plan to position Mesh early as core contributor to Cardano open source governance tooling. We have the needed experience and expertise to provide high quality tooling and we see it as our responsibility to leverage our know-how and skill set towards Cardanos Governance evolution. Providing HQ and open source tooling around governance is a key to ensure that people have the right tools to solve upcoming challenges.

J. Final thoughts/comments
Thanks for everyone contributing, reviewing Milestones, voting on our proposal and everything inbetween. As a small yet effective open source developer project, we highly appreciate the support and encouragement we have received and receive from the Cardano Ecosystem.
