## Milestone 4 Report

Hey there Catalyst Milestone Reviewer ðŸ™‚

As mentioned in our just submitted PoA on Milestone 3, here the report on the completion of Milestone 4, which features have been deployed in the latest MeshJS V1.6.2. 

So, lets go fo our Milestone 4 deliverables which we stated as following:

Maintaining MeshJS Code library and features
Working on Updates and the development of new features to enrich already existing libraries
New features: revamped/refactored Transaction and Utilities class
Maintaining and moderating the MeshJS Github Repositories, managing pull request
Maintaining and moderating our Discord Server, providing support and guidance for the MeshJS Builder Community
Monthly report in form of a recorded Team Meeting
Here the Proof of Achievement in detail:

### Development / Github

#### Maintain Code libraries and features Github repositories

The MeshJS open source repositories on github are as usual well maintained and accessible via MeshJS Github and new issues from contributors are getting resolved and implemented.

MeshJS Github currently hosts 23 repositories which are ready for use for any builder keen to build on Cardano, you can access the repoâ€™s via our Github on: 
https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories 

Or on our website for easier access at:
https://meshjs.dev/ 

#### New features: revamped/refactored Transaction and Utilities class

New features have been deployed in our Mesh 1.6 version, including the promised revamped/refactored Transaction and Utilities class. You can find the code, open sourced under Apache-2.0 licence on https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh. 

#### Some more insights.

Excluding merges, 3 authors have pushed 20 commits to main and 28 commits to all branches. On main, 1,373 files have changed and there have been 63,854 additions and 96,676 deletions.

Maintaining and moderating our Discord Server, providing support and guidance for the MeshJS Builder Community

The MeshJS Discord remains an active and productive community hub. As noted in earlier Milestone reports, the primary traffic has shifted from public general channels to specific private channels. These private channels are most effective when used in a timely and dynamic manner; once a topic is resolved, the need for the channel typically ends, and new channels emerge for new topics. 

The most used public channels on our Mesh Discord are; 
- #ask-team
- #chill-here

MeshJS Discord user count: 643 (August 1, 2024)
