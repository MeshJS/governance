3) Maintain fully operational MeshJS Code library and features

As this proposal title subscribes, the ‚Äúmaintain MeshJS‚Äù focuses on keeping the already existing MeshJS library and features online. We are happy that the library and features are continued to be live and accessible for everyone building on Cardano. You can check the activities on our Website or Github. 

If you are not familiar with github, we recommend that you look at Github insights such as: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/compare/88024496f50c8358b688a36e005a67d64dc66837...main 

4) Actively moderated Discord Server by the Admins

Thanks to this proposal, we also have funds to reward the Admin for continuing the moderation of the MeshJS Discord server which was and is a lively space for developers to learn about everything building on Cardano. Most moderation is done by @jinglescode & davincitoast

5) Active maintained Github repositories by the Admins

Similar to ‚Äú3)‚Äù, we keep and maintain our Github repositories live and continuously updated. In the last month we have pushed 16 commits to main and 30 commits to all branches. On main, 118 files have changed and there have been 81,343 additions and 2,587 deletions.

6) Finalised and recorded Monthly report meeting

For some additional insights on the Project, we ran and recorded a quick monthly report meeting with MeshJS Admins (Jingles, Hinson, Felix).

The video is available at:

To summarise everything‚Ä¶ We are glad to have the community's support in our goal at MeshJS to provide open source community tools at highest quality and to ensure that builders find valuable resources to develop their projects on the Cardano Blockchain.
