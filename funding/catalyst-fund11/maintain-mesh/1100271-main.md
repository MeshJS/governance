[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution.
Implementation and integration of Voltaire features, Hydra, Aiken, Koios, Maestro and more. This can include bounties for qualified issues & features, and building learning materials.

MeshJS is a key contributor to Cardano open source, supporting and empowering Cardano developers to build tools and solutions to further enhance and develop the Cardano Ecosystem. 

At this point of time, MeshJS is mostly runned on a fully volunteer basis. We had a funded Proposal in Project Catalyst Fund 10 to enable the development of new features and to incentivise contributions from the MeshJS Builders Community. However we are lacking some basic financial resources to provide some stable financial security to our core crew and contributors.

This proposal hopes to enable some basic funding support to help us keep building and doing what we do. Building and maintaining an open-source library and providing numerous tools to easily build powerful dApps on the Cardano blockchain. 

[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community.
MeshJS code is widely used within the Cardano Ecosystem, providing numerous tools and support for Cardano developers to easily build and enhance the Cardano ecosystem. Some noticeably positive impacts including but not limit to:

Speed up development on any core Cardano updates, including hard fork (Voltaire governance action), CIP updates, Hydra transaction building.
Speed up ecosystem integration in different aspects, including on-chain code building libraries (e.g. Aiken), node service (e.g. Maestro, Blockfrost, Koios).
Reduce dApps downtime when dependencies introduce breaking changes, such as node service endpoint changes.
These improvements would benefit hundreds of dApps building on MeshJS, which has material impacts on the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.

[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
Trust and accountability:

MeshJS is one of the open source libraries with highest quality in the Cardano ecosystem. Our previous work is the best and most sincere argument to showcase that we have been constantly delivering our promises since inception.

Feasibility:

MeshJS team has inside out knowledge on Cardano and software development in all domains of Cardano DApp development. We understand what users and developers need and have a strong track record which undermines our competency in the field

[Project Milestones] What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
As mentioned above, in [CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] MeshJS MeshJS is one of the open source libraries with highest quality in the Cardano ecosystem. Our previous work is the best and most sincere argument to showcase that we have been constantly delivering our promises since inception. Our tools support a wide range of active Cardano Builders and Projects who benefit strongly from free access to our open source solution. We do not see our code being taken closed-source for financial benefit, and the value for money here is that the Cardano Treasury is effectively used to help us in continuously pushing on new open source solutions for the entire Cardano Developer Community.

Or, Lucas gives a good point on that too

"I don't got beef with anyone or any specific proposals BUT I'd like to say the whole vibe around catalyst has been really cringe. Many proposals sound reasonable, useful, and chill. But idk the vibe ain't right and there clearly seems to be a kind of abuse. Companies asking for funds to pay for what should be business expenses should not be included. Companies asking for funds to build open source tools and standards is awesome. I think considering that we, the community, are not entitled to some kind of return on "investment" then really this VC notion is nonsensical. At this point we should really only allow builders of open tools, standards, and protocols in. This way at the very least everyone gets a return on the "investment". I ain't seen a dime from catalyst BUT I have used open software produced with effort paid by it's funds."
