## Milestone 5 Report & Close Out

Hey there Catalyst Milestone Reviewer, voters and anyone following our work and progress. 

We are happy to close the 5th and final Milestone of our Fund11 proposal.

Here the stated acceptance criteria which we successfully completed:

- Finalised new feature: "Conway features"

Conway features have been successfully implemented, and the Mesh stack is ready for the Chang Hardfork events. Developers can easily continue the use of our tools in the upcoming Voltaire Era. PlutusV3, Updated cost models and general transaction structure changed to fit conway.

This Mesh tweet gives a great summary on our work in getting everything Conway ready & integrated: https://x.com/meshsdk/status/1832061073484071347 

- Maintain fully operational MeshJS Code library and features

All Mesh code and features are as mentioned well updated  and ready to be integrated into the network update with the Chang Hardfork: 

In August 2024, 5 authors pushed 194 commits to main and 202 commits to all branches. On main, 1,486 files have changed and there have been 75,401 additions and 97,555 deletions. This includes the successful deployment of the previously mentioned Conway features.

- Actively moderated Discord Server by the Admins

Our Discord server is well maintained and is kept a lively and active community hub for developers to chat and Q&A with each other on all things Mesh and building on Cardano. 

As mentioned in previous Milestone PoA's, a nice mix of open and private channels on the server help to coordinate communications and activities around specific mesh topics and projects. All channels, public as private are actively moderated by admins and project contributors. 

- Active maintained Github repositories by the Admins

The Mesh stack is well maintained and is up and running as open source licenced code on our github repositories. A nice surprise for us is that MeshJS has become a leader in Open Source contribution, check the tweets from https://x.com/ProofOfCardano which show MeshJS in lead ranking of Cardano developments. 

Right now, Mesh hosts & maintains 26 github repositories which can be found at:
