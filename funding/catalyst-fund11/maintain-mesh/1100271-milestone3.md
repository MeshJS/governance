## Milestone 3 Report

Hey there Catalyst Milestone Reviewer ðŸ™‚

We are glad to report on the completion of Milestone 3 as well as Milestone 4, which features have been deployed in the latest MeshJS V1.6.2. We took a little longer in the execution as the Plutus V3 integrations at Milestone 3 and refactored Transaction features of Milestone 4 had been highly dependent on each other, therefore we took a little more time to ship on both deliverables of the new features. This report aims to close Milestone 3 and we are submitting in parallel Milestone 4 as well in the respective Milestone section. The development work covers all the work which has been undertaken in the months of June and July 2024.

So, lets go fo our Milestone 3 deliverables which we stated as following:

Maintaining MeshJS Code library and features
Working on Updates and the development of new features to enrich already existing libraries
New features: Plutus version 3 integration
Maintaining and moderating the MeshJS Github Repositories, managing pull request
Maintaining and moderating our Discord Server, providing support and guidance for the MeshJS Builder Community
Monthly report in form of a recorded Team Meeting
Here the Proof of Achievement in detail:

### Development / Github

#### Maintain Code libraries and features Github repositories

The MeshJS open source repositories on github are as usual well maintained and accessible via MeshJS Github and new issues from contributors are getting resolved and implemented.

MeshJS Github currently hosts 23 repositories which are ready for use for any builder keen to build on Cardano, you can access the repoâ€™s via our Github on: 
https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories 

Or on our website for easier access at:
https://meshjs.dev/ 

Remarkable and worth a note is the key contribution from SIDAN Lab to MeshJS code. It has been a while now (1 year+) since first collaborations started and our close work with SIDAN Lab led to a great builders friendship from which we can expect quite a few exciting things to come. We wholeheartedly thank SIDAN lab for their constant support and contribution to our developments and looking forward to a great builders partnership.

#### New features: Plutus version 3 integration

Took us quite a while, little longer than expected but here it is. New features have been deployed in our Mesh 1.6 version, including the promised plutus V3 integration. You can find the code, open sourced under Apache-2.0 licence on https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh. Some additional fancy latest developments are as well introduced via our X(Twitter), check: https://x.com/meshsdk/status/1819792496941044209 

#### Some more insights.

Excluding merges, 3 authors have pushed 20 commits to main and 28 commits to all branches. On main, 1,373 files have changed and there have been 63,854 additions and 96,676 deletions.

### Maintaining and moderating our Discord Server, providing support and guidance for the MeshJS Builder Community

The MeshJS Discord remains an active and productive community hub. As noted in earlier Milestone reports, the primary traffic has shifted from public general channels to specific private channels. These private channels are most effective when used in a timely and dynamic manner; once a topic is resolved, the need for the channel typically ends, and new channels emerge for new topics. 

The most used public channels on our Mesh Discord are; 

- #ask-team
- #chill-here

#### Monthly Team meeting

Here the recording of our Team meeting, summarising this Milestone and providing some additional insights and perspectives of our work. The meeting covers both Milestones, number 3 and 4 of our proposal and captures a retrospective of our activities for the months of June and July 2024.

#### Additional observations & insights

Ramping up Capabilities

First of all, it is important to mention how thankful we are for the cardano community voting and supporting our open source development for the Cardano Ecosystem. The funds are an immense help in building some financial security around our project which we couldn't achieve elsewise as all our work is fully open source. Funded MeshJS Proposals do a crucial thing, getting our folks full-time cardano. While most contributors had their day job in earlier days, we are now able to engage on Cardano at a full-time position, increasing our capabilities and performances to provide high quality open source code to the further growth of the Cardano ecosystem. Our long term goal is to establish MeshJS as a open source developer powerhouse for the Asian region, and step by step we are getting there. 

Building up our Network

Our increased capabilities help us as well to position MeshJS as the go-to one-stop-shop for developers interested and ready to build on Cardano. Our work makes the rounds and also allows us to build a strong reputation and track record within the cardano open source developer ecosystem, enabling additional direct collaborations and partnerships with other projects such as SIDAN Labs and Gimbalabs, the Lace developer team and Defy. We are glad that we arrive well to establish our relations within the builders community and looking forward to maintain and extend our collaborations and partnerships within the Cardano Ecosystem. 

Fund 13 - Continuation 

At the time of writing (August, week 1) we also got the voting results from Project Catalyst Fund 12, which approved the continuation of Sustaining and maintaining our Work at MeshJS with our funded proposal of Fund 12 - Sustain & Maintain MeshJS. We are deeply grateful for everyone who supports our work :)
