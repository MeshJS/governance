Category Questions
Mention your open source license and describe your open source license rationale.
All code of this project will be published under the already existing Apache 2.0 Open source licence which covers all code of our open source Mesh SDK
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh 

How do you make sure your source code is accessible to the public from project start, and people are informed?
Since there are already more than 800 projects using our SDK, the way from deployment to use is very short and effective. To inform developers we will provide additional announcements on our Mesh Discord server as well as on our Mesh Twitter account.
How will you provide high quality documentation?
The Mesh Docs are already well advanced and will be accordingly updated, furthermore we aim to optimise our Docs not only for human developers, but also for Ai models to ensure that developers using ai have high quality Docs for their ai models available.

[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution.
Our Mesh SDK is great, tho surely not perfect. As we are well aware of its current limitations we know that we  need a more unified, modular, and developer-friendly transaction building framework. Today, tx-builders across Whisky, core-csl, and core-cst are fragmented, inconsistent, and lack clear design principles. This slows developers down, creates duplication, and makes extending or maintaining transaction logic unnecessarily complex, so yes, we definitely know that we can and have to improve, this proposal enables funds for us to do so..
Our solution is a structured refactor and redesign. We will start by researching existing transaction libraries, gathering developer feedback, and defining solid design principles. These principles will guide a refactor of the Whisky tx-builder as the foundation for a new Tx class, followed by alignment of core-cst with core-csl to eliminate fragmentation. Mesh's own TxBuilder will then be updated, with refreshed documentation and release notes to ensure transparency and usability.
The final stage delivers a new Tx class, fully modular, consistent and built on the defined principles accompanied by comprehensive developer documentation, a close-out report, and a video walkthrough. This work will improve and level up Mesh's transaction building into a more reliable, maintainable, and developer-friendly framework, accelerating dApp development on Cardano.


[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community.
This project will significantly strengthen the developer experience within the Cardano ecosystem by providing a unified, consistent, and well-documented transaction building framework. Developers will be able to build, extend, and maintain dApps more efficiently, with fewer errors and less duplicated effort. By reducing fragmentation across libraries and aligning MeshJS with clear design principles, the project lowers the entry barrier for new developers while giving experienced teams a more reliable foundation to scale complex applications. A standardized TxBuilder and modular Tx class will also encourage interoperability, improve code reusability, and accelerate innovation across the ecosystem. In the long term, this contributes to higher quality dApps, faster time to market for new projects, and stronger adoption of Cardano as a developer-friendly blockchain.

Counting the already strong user base of our Mesh SDK with more than 800 projects depending on our code and more than 10k monthly npm downloads, we are sure that the developed tx updates will find a quick and effective way into direct use and benefit for other projects using the Mesh SDK

[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
Mesh has been a longtime contributor to the cardano open source developer ecosystem. Our tools are widely used and we have proven our skills and commitment by building and maintaining essential tools which empower many to build on cardano since 2022. Over the time, by non-stop breathing and building Cardano, we have gained some finest expertise which makes it quite likely that we are able to validate and achieve our proposal objectives properly. 

We are also proud and glad to have participated in catalyst since Fund 10, and as of today, we are well familiar with the process of completing proposals. For more information about all our funded proposals, their progress and details, we have built a dashboard which makes it easy for you to assess and audit our capabilities of delivering on our promises keeping the style of "don't trust, verify":

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?

The most reliable way for open-source tools to show their "value for money" is by looking at real usage data-checking how actively the code is used across the developer ecosystem and identifying how many, and what kind of, projects build with our tooling. At Mesh, we currently see over 800 dependent projects making use of our SDK, with around 10k npm downloads every month. This makes Mesh one of the most widely adopted Cardano open-source stacks, supporting projects across the entire spectrum to build on Cardano. These numbers show clearly that the budgets we receive translate into strong metrics, proving that treasury funds are effectively used to deliver solutions that are practical, useful, and solve real developer problems.
The funds from this proposal directly enable us to reward contributors and maintainers of the codebase, while also ensuring that all projects depending on Mesh continue to benefit from a constantly evolving set of features available entirely free, without paywalls, and safeguarded by an open-source license.
