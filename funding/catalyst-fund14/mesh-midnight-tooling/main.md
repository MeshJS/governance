[GENERAL] What is the exact problem you want to solve? (200-character limit including spaces)  
Developers need smart contracts and integrated UI templates designed for scalability and modularity, supported by a framework. These templates will showcase practical, real-world Midnight applications.



[GENERAL] Summarize your solution to the problem (200-character limit including spaces)  
We will build and deliver modular smart contracts and UI templates, supported by a reusable framework, enabling developers to deploy privacy-enabled apps and reuse them across real-world cases.

[GENERAL] Does your project have any dependencies on other organizations, technical or otherwise?  
Yes



[GENERAL] If YES, please describe what the dependency is and why you believe it is essential for your project's delivery.  
Dependency on Midnight Network — essential for deployment, testing, and ensuring integration with the privacy-enabled blockchain environment.



[GENERAL] Will your project's output/s be fully open source?  
Yes



[GENERAL] Please provide here more information on the open source status of your project outputs  
All outputs will be released under the MIT License, ensuring permissive use, reuse, and contribution.

Category Questions  

Mention your open source license and describe your open source license rationale.  
All code and templates produced will be released under the MIT License. This permissive license encourages broad adoption and reuse, supports both open-source and commercial use, and lowers barriers for developers.

How do you make sure your source code is accessible to the public from project start, and people are informed?  
We use GitHub to host repositories from project start. All development is tracked publicly via GitHub Projects, ensuring stakeholders can monitor progress.

How will you provide high quality documentation?  
Each contract and UI module will include a README.md. A documentation site with tutorials, guides, and educational content will be created for developers to easily adopt and extend the framework.




[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution.  
We will create four modular smart contracts with integrated UI, API, and testing:

1. Tokenization: Minting, burning, and fractionalizing assets  
2. Staking: Delegation mechanics and rewards distribution  
3. Identity: DID flows and provider integration  
4. Oracles: Secure on-chain data feed consumption  

These will be reusable templates, delivered within a structured framework (Contracts, API, Frontend folders) that streamlines the full development lifecycle.



[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community.  
- Makes it easier for developers to build privacy-preserving apps with Midnight.  
- Lowers entry barriers through reusable contracts and UI templates.  
- Promotes interoperability with existing/future contracts.  
- Enables real-world business use cases (tokenization, staking, identity, oracles).  
- Integrates with MeshJS tooling to align with Cardano workflows.  
- Encourages collaboration and reuse across the ecosystem.  
- Measured via GitHub activity, adoption, and developer engagement.  



[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY]  
We have:  
1. Won multiple Midnight hackathons (1st & 2nd places).  
2. Contributed to official Awesome Midnight repositories.  
3. Produced developer educational content via Discord.  
4. Public GitHub project management for transparency.  
5. Proven track record with MeshJS tooling (SDK, Starter Template, wallet widget).  

This proposal builds directly on top of our working starter template, making it low-risk and highly feasible.

[RESOURCES] Who is in the project team and what are their roles?  
- Smart contract & full-stack developer: Erick Romero  
- Project Management: Mesh Core Team  
- Treasury Management: Mesh Core Team  



[BUDGET & COSTS] Cost breakdown  

1. Development – Smart Contracts & Full-Stack (80% = 48,000 ADA)  
   - Scope: Design, implement, test contracts & framework.  
   - Resources: Smart contract engineer + full-stack developer.  

2. Project Management (10% = 6,000 ADA)  
   - Scope: Coordination, planning, tracking, reporting.  
   - Resources: Project manager, GitHub Projects.  

3. Treasury Management (10% = 6,000 ADA)  
   - Scope: Financial oversight, accounting, buffer for ADA volatility.  
   - Resources: Treasury oversight team.  



[VALUE FOR MONEY]  
This 60,000 ADA budget covers 10 months of specialized work.  
- Costs are aligned with blockchain developer & PM market rates.  
- Builds on existing MeshJS SDK and Starter Template → reduces risk and accelerates delivery.  
- Outputs are open-source, reusable, and interoperable → lowering barriers for new developers and fostering a privacy-enabled application ecosystem on Midnight.
