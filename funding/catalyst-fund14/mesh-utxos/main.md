Mesh UTXOS: Supercharge Business Onboarding to Cardano
[GENERAL] Name and surname of main applicant
Mesh

[GENERAL] Requested Funds in Ada

490,000 Ada

[GENERAL] What is the exact problem you want to solve? (200-character limit including spaces)
Cardano and Bitcoin lack business-ready onboarding tools such as non custodial wallets, social logins and gasless transactions, leaving them behind ecosystems like Ethereum.

[GENERAL] Summarize your solution to the problem (200-character limit including spaces)
UTXOS provides wallet-as-a-service, transaction sponsorship, and fiat on-ramp, enabling seamless onboarding and adoption for Cardano and Bitcoin apps.

[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution.
Building on Cardano and Bitcoin today feels like Ethereum in 2016. Apps are coming, but the user experience is still broken. No social logins, no gasless transactions, and users drop off before onboarding.
On EVM chains, tools like Privy and Web3Auth solve this. On UTXO chains, no one is. That gap is our opportunity.
Mesh has long contributed to Cardano’s open-source ecosystem. Now we are channeling that expertise into UTXOS, an infrastructure platform that removes onboarding friction and grows DAUs. It enables businesses to scale apps without needing deep blockchain expertise.
This proposal funds the next stage of UTXOS: enhancing the platform and onboarding a first wave of clients, securing real-world usage and revenue, and taking a step toward long-term sustainability for Mesh.
The roadmap is here: https://docs.utxos.dev/roadmap
To ensure a strong launch, we are teaming up with Mercuryo for fiat on/off-ramp integration and Checkpoint for security. Together, Mesh, Checkpoint, and Mercuryo bring the essentials for taking UTXOS from code to clients quickly and safely.

Mercuryo: https://mercuryo.io/


Furthermore we are  running BD efforts with experienced Cardano advisors, ensuring client outreach while our developers stay focused on building.


[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community.
At Mesh, the path from deployment to usage is short. Today, more than 900 projects rely on our tools, with over 120 already using the UTXOS SDK. Our goal is to expand this base and convert Mesh users into UTXOS adopters.
Impact is twofold:
For projects, UTXOS enables Web2-like onboarding such as social logins and gasless flows that make apps frictionless for users.


For Mesh, UTXOS revenue builds sustainability, ensuring long-term support and growth of our Cardano developer contribution to consistently advance ecosystem tooling.


To track adoption, UTXOS usage data will be published on our public dashboard for transparent community insights. Current Mesh stats: https://gov.meshjs.dev/mesh-stats 



[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
Mesh has been a longtime contributor to the cardano open source developer ecosystem. Our tools are widely used and we have proven our skills and commitment by building and maintaining essential tools which empower many to build on cardano since 2022. Over the time, by non-stop breathing and building Cardano, we have gained some finest expertise which makes it quite likely that we are able to validate and achieve our proposal objectives properly.
We have the technical expertise, ecosystem trust, and partner network to validate and deliver UTXOS. This proposal does not aim for instant massive returns, yet, to be a solid step toward recurring revenue and our sustainability within the Cardano ecosystem.

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
Our proposal budget represents strong value for Cardano, since UTXOS directly addresses several of the ecosystem’s most pressing adoption barriers like user onboarding, transaction volume and developer Experience
Instead of every project reinventing complex wallet and onboarding infrastructure, UTXOS delivers a shared solution. By leveraging Mesh’s existing adoption across more than 900 projects, UTXOS has a strong  potential for solid reach and uptake.
The most important value yet, is definitely in the fact that the community encourages and empowers us and others to build products which help not only the ecosystem to grow, but  also help us to become long-term sustainable. We really love to build on Cardano, but we can't expect to solely rely on grant funding as we and many other Cardano dev projects do. The ecosystem invests in us, and we want to prove that we are worth it.
