[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution
Buidler Fest #1 in Toulouse successfully introduced an effective event format for the Cardano builder community. The goal of the original event, led by Matthias Benkort and Arnauld, was to encourage the community to continue and adapt this event model in various regions. Builder Fest Asia aims to build on this success, enhancing connections and collaboration among builders across Asia. Rather than replicating the original, this version will refine and tailor the format to suit the specific needs of the region.

This project is a collaborative effort involving MeshJS, SIDAN Lab, SociousDAO, and Cardano Vietnam, leveraging each group’s expertise to ensure smooth organization and impactful outcomes.

Event Location: Vietnam
Event Structure:
Day 1: Technical presentations and community development workshops.
Day 2: Open-Space sessions and hackathons to promote collaboration.
Our goal is to ensure seamless organization, attract top talent, and provide a rich, engaging experience for participants.

Why Host Cardano Builder Fest in Asia?

1.Strengthen Connections Among Asian Developers

The developer and builder communities in Asia are rapidly growing but remain fragmented. Builder Fest will provide an opportunity to bridge these gaps, fostering collaboration and contributing to the growth of the Cardano ecosystem.

2.Thriving Communities Actively Contributing to Cardano

Asia is home to vibrant communities like MeshJS, SIDAN Lab, Socious, and Cardano Builder Vietnam (Minswap), all of which are actively driving progress within Cardano. Hosting the event in Asia capitalizes on these efforts, further uniting and amplifying the contributions of these communities.

Why Host the Event in Vietnam?

1.Abundant IT and Blockchain Talent, Young Workforce

Vietnam has emerged as a tech hub in Southeast Asia, with over 530,000 software engineers and 50,000-57,000 IT graduates entering the workforce each year. Success stories like Sky Mavis, the creator of Axie Infinity, demonstrate Vietnam’s blockchain capabilities

[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community
Building on the success of Buidler Fest #1, Cardano Builder Fest Asia aims to create a collaborative platform to strengthen connections between developers and builders in the Cardano ecosystem. This event will foster deeper relationships and spark new friendships, leading to potential collaborative projects among individuals and communities.

Moreover, adopting an open-event model with hackathon and informal conference formats will encourage innovation through practical workshops and hands-on hackathons. These experiences will not only yield tangible results but also provide learning and development opportunities for participants.

The event will also generate compelling multimedia content—such as videos, photos, and interviews—shared widely on social media channels. This exposure will promote the vibrant activities of the Cardano developer community to both technical and non-technical audiences, expanding the ecosystem’s influence and attracting new interest from diverse groups.

Through this comprehensive approach, Cardano Builder Fest Asia will act as a catalyst for long-term collaboration and sustainable development within the Cardano ecosystem.

Budget Sheet



[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
The Cardano Builder Asia Fest offers substantial value aligned with the funding request, ensuring a high return on investment for Catalyst. Below are the key arguments justifying the proposal’s value for money:

1. Significant Value to the Cardano Ecosystem

This event will connect developers and builders across Asia, providing hands-on workshops, networking opportunities, and spaces for open-source contributions. Such activities enhance collaboration, foster new partnerships, and encourage knowledge sharing, driving innovation within the ecosystem. The success of Buidler Fest #1 proves that a hacker-style, unconference format stimulates meaningful engagement and builds long-term relationships, helping sustain Cardano’s growth (buidl.2024.cardano.org).

2. Market-Aligned Budget

The proposed budget is meticulously planned, with costs aligned with local market rates. To ensure transparency, we will provide receipts and invoices for all expenses incurred. This ensures that Catalyst funds are used responsibly, maximizing the impact without unnecessary overhead.

Please see details in Comparison table.

3. Cost Efficiency Through Community Involvement

Most logistics and event coordination will be handled by dedicated community members and the organizing team, reducing external staffing costs. This community-driven approach significantly lowers operational expenses while ensuring high-quality event delivery.

4. Affordable Costs in Vietnam

Vietnam offers a cost-effective venue compared to other regional hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong. This allows us to organize a large-scale, high-quality event within a reasonable budget. The lower cost of logistics, accommodation, and venue rentals ensures that more resources can be allocated toward content, activities, and participant engagement.

For example, hotel costs: according to statistics from the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), the average hotel cost is 162 USD. In our budget, the cost for an international standard room in Vietnam is only 70 USD per day, saving 57%. This leads to substantial cost savings for the Builder Fest event, which has 110 participants.

Additionally, Vietnam’s young, skilled workforce specializing in IT and blockchain makes it an ideal location to attract regional developers to the event.

Conclusion

This event not only optimizes the budget but also delivers long-term value to the Cardano ecosystem. Open-source outputs, including tools, documentation, and networking opportunities, will strengthen the community and inspire new initiatives, ensuring sustainable growth. With 30,200 USD requested from Catalyst, this proposal strategically allocates resources to maximize the event's impact, foster innovation, and generate lasting benefits for the Cardano community.

Value for money - Value for the Cardano Ecosystem

The Value for money considers optimized savings compared to the level of seniority and experience of the team benchmarking at the local level.
