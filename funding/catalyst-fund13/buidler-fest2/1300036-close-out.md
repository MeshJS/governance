Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and
engagement)

Key achievements can be clearly stated as:
- Successfully hosted the event, providing a great space for Cardano builders to meet and
connect, to share knowledge and insights and to build meaningful relations.

Event attendees: 121 attendees (including event organisers)
We envisioned to have at least 50 event attendees with a max cap on 100 attendees,
however the waiting list and desire of builders to join has been so strong that we
increased the max attendee number. Definitely a success. We are also glad that the
increased number of attendees has been well managed and facilitated and that we have
been able to offer more places as we envisioned.

Total Amount of speakers and sessions:
On day 1, In total, we had 4 Panel discussions with a total amount of 28 speakers and 8
workshops which took place over the two days. A well packed agenda, yet with enough
space and time for builders to hang out.

Day 2, which was set in an unconference style, booked a total of 10 workshops with a
total of 10 speakers/presenters. We are glad that we got that much interest from
attendees who stepped up to host their workshops on a wide range of topics, all around
building on Cardano.

You can find a summary of the Agenda at:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AhELsUDxyc8Y0Zodq2egvB49dUJFT-Wzey5
Ue10fx1E/edit?usp=sharing

Furthermore we are glad to have achieved:
- Successful collaboration across several asian based cardano builder projects to
organise & host builder fest as a collective effort
- Keeping Buidler Fest authentic, a cosy space for nerds and hackers, thinkers and
builders in a mixed style of a un-conference, tiny hackathon, open space and whatnot,
keeping things more informal and open as the usually known web3 spaces and
conferences.
- Actually was a great example as well to see how Catalyst funding can be well used to
support and enable such events and to highlight how relevant and impactful non-tech
and non-product funding categories are.

Key learnings

1. Vibes are a real thing
- It's awesome to see what happens if you take a hundred of Cardano finest at a location where
they can meet and connect, share and learn and totally nerd out with others over a long
weekend. The atmosphere and energy was simply great and definitely an experience worth its
time and efforts. We had several developers join a cardano event for the first time, with the
feedback received that this event definitely gave the appetite to join more. If anything to improve
dev experience on Cardano, well, do the builder fest ^^

2. Collaboration Challenges
- Collaboration is great, too much is difficult. In our case, we had collaborations with maybe a few
too many different entities and projects who collaborated on this proposal. The alignment and
cohesion of the projects was at times really challenging since each project also has some
individual perspectives and priorities (and strong ideas for sure). Facilitating the alignment took
considerable time and effort and despite the best will from everyone to work together, we still
lost one collaborator along the way. It wouldnt be fair to blame or shame anyone, more
important is to keep in mind that collaboration for hosting such events is great until a certain size
and that too many projects being involved, at times, can cause risks and challenges which can
be scaled down and minimised by keeping the collaborators network and performance at
effective size.

3. Building upon
- Continuing and evolving the builders Fest from its initial version in 2024 in Toulouse, France,
was great. We had the advantage of being able to copy paste and apply a lot of concepts which
had already been bootstrapped in the initial Builder Fest 2024.
The original Buidler Fest concept is pretty awesome and having learnings from 2024 available
has helped us a lot since we didn't had to build everything from scratch. We hope that our
experiences are equally helpful to the organisers of a follow up builder fest in 2026 and we also
hope that the Buidler Fest finds a great further evolution over the years to come.

---

Next steps for the product or service developed
- The success of the event definitely motivates and inspires to host a follow up event the next
year, tho, we also believe that it is great that the Buidler Fest changes location and organisers
each time. Therefore, we may not host the next builder fest ourselves, tho, we definitely will
propose support to anyone expressing their interest to take charge of a builder fest next year.

---

Final thoughts/comments
- The event was great and presents a great use case of organising valuable events for cardano
developers via project Catalyst. With that it might be worth keeping in mind how important and
impactful the non-technical funding category is since this proposal would not have fitted in any
other available funding categories.
Also a massive thanks to the Cardano Foundation which provided additional support without
which the event could have not taken place.
