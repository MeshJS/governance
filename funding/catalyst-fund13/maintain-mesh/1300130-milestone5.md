## Reports on Each Item

### MeshJS GitHub Repositories & Activity

#### meshjs/mesh

Our core repository at meshjs/mesh is as usual very active and well maintained and we see a healthy increase of projects using our open source code stack to build their own projects. Here our core repo in numbers:

https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh

In June 2025, excluding merges, 9 authors have pushed 60 commits to main and 71 commits to all branches. On main, 103 files have changed and there have been 2,667 additions and 820 deletions.

### Dependencies

On the date of writing this report, June 30, 2025, we have a total of 809 dependencies on MeshJS/mesh repository which marks an increase of 9 new projects in June 2025, compared to 800 dependencies last month in May 2025. The lowest monthly growth of new projects since the proposal execution started.

Continuing to reflect monthly growth we see that we have a constant and stable growth of builders using Mesh for their projects. These numbers are a nice indicator to prove the usefulness of our core repo and we are pretty proud of seeing that much active and constant use of Mesh code in the Cardano open source developer ecosystem.

Projects building on Mesh:

- February: 626
- March: 671
- April: 735
- May: 800
- June: 809

You can find all dependencies at: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents

### Downloads

Continuing to track new metrics to measure success, we start to track weekly and monthly downloads of our code via https://www.npmjs.com/package/@meshsdk/core where we see a total amount of 7,829 downloads in June 2025. Another indicator which shows a strong usage of our code.

When reflecting on monthly downloads since January this year, we see a stable number of downloads.

- February: 7,458
- March: 10,635
- April: 8,551
- May: 8,649

### Mesh Open Source Repositories

At the date of June 30, 2025, MeshJS hosts a total of 43 repositories on the MeshJS GitHub from which currently 33 are public open source repositories.

You can find all public Mesh GitHub repositories under:  
https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories

Wrapping everything up on the code side, Mesh is actually doing pretty well. We constantly increase the quality and active use of our open source stack. Our stack is constantly improving and maturing.

## Mesh Discord Server

Same as our GitHub repos, our Discord server is kept well active and maintained and we see a constant engagement from developers and our crew who are quick in responding to questions and issues.

Here the server activity for June 2025 in numbers:

- Total Number of messages: 3,700 (last month = 2,703)
- Total Number of visitors: 166 (last month = 161)
- Total Number of members: 754 (last month = 732)

Our main public channel, the #ask-team forum stays the main channel to answer questions to developers.  
The forum activities for the #ask-team forum in June 2025:

- Readers: 64 (last month = 63)
- Chatters: 16 (last month = 30)
- Messages: 230 (last month = 452)

Since the Milestone reviewers of the previous maintain-mesh proposal milestones stated their appreciation on Mesh sharing Discord server insight screenshot-videos, we continue providing that since it helps you to assess and audit.

## Thanks

And that's itâ€¦

We deeply thank everyone who helped to make this proposal happen, from voters to builders, Milestone Reviewers and the Catalyst Admin Team. Thanks to everyone for this smooth and straightforward proposal journey and to help Mesh becoming step-by-step, one of the most successful and used open source projects in the Cardano ecosystem, where a few are able to support and empower the many.
