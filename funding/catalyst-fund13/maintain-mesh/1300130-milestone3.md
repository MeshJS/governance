### MeshJS github repositories & activity
#### MeshJS/mesh
Our core repository at meshjs/mesh is active and well maintained and we see a healthy increase of projects using our open source code stack to build their own projects, here our core repo in numbers.

- https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh

In April 2025,  7 authors have pushed 103 commits to main and 124 commits to all branches. On main, 161 files have changed and there have been 14,862 additions and 2,771 deletions.

#### Dependencies
We have currently 735 dependencies on MeshJS/mesh repository which marks an increase of 64 new projects in April 2025, compared to 671 dependencies in March 2025. 

Reflecting monthly growth we see that we have a constant and stable growth of builders using mesh for their projects. These numbers are a nice indicator to prove the usefulness of our core repo and we are pretty proud of seeing that much active use of mesh code at the Cardano open source developer ecosystem 

- January: 591
- February: 626
- March: 671
- April: 735

You can find all dependencies at: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents 

#### Downloads
Continuing to track new metric to measure success, we start to track weekly and monthly downloads of our code via https://www.npmjs.com/package/@meshsdk/core where we see a strong number of currently 1468 downloads per week, 

#### Mesh open source repositories
At the date of April 30, 2025, MeshJS hosts a total of 40 repositories on the MeshJS github from which currently 27 are public open source repositories. You can find all public Mesh github repositories under: https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories.
