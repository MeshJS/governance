[GENERAL] Please provide here more information on the open source status of your project outputs
MeshJS is an experienced core contributor to the Cardano open source developer ecosystem. All code is and will maintain open sourced, public and usable for anyone to build upon. We see our work as crucial open source ecosystem infrastructure which has to follow high quality open source standards.

[METADATA] Horizons
Developer Tools
[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution
Our Cardano libraries, guides and tools are well known and used and as we provide our services for free and open source and as we don't plan to change that, we are asking for Funding to maintain and operate already existing MeshJS code for a time frame of 5 months.

Since the first maintain MeshJS proposal in Catalyst Fund 10, we kept our stack well maintained and updated and more importantly, we enhanced and further develop the existing stack, slowly growing the mesh open source repositories into a more and more effective value for Cardano developers, senior devs as well as newcomers.

[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community
Boost Developer Efficiency: Simplified processes and enhanced tools will reduce development time and frustrations, attracting more developers to build innovative solutions on Cardano.
Enhance Community Collaboration: Open-source contributions and comprehensive documentation will foster a transparent and inclusive community environment, encouraging ongoing engagement and innovation.
Drive Ecosystem Growth: With improved resources at their disposal, developers can create more robust applications, thus accelerating the growth and scalability of the Cardano platform.
All together, increasing the number of projects and people using our tooling. Right now, for example, our main repo at Mesh is used in 458 different cases (https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents) which is a number we are quite proud about and which we want to grow.

[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
MeshJS is one of the open source libraries with highest quality in the Cardano ecosystem. Our previous work is the best and most sincere argument to showcase that we have been constantly delivering our promises since inception and we have an inside out knowledge on Cardano and software development in all domains of Cardano dApp development. We understand what users and developers need and have a strong track record which undermines our competency in the field.

As our Milestones focus on purely maintaining existing tech stack and the developer support on Discord, there are very little unexpected risks or unforseen scenarios which could hinder the successful implementation of the Proposal.

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
As a committed Cardano open source developer project with several years experience, we have built a really strong expertise on cardano development. We know well about the builders and the communities needs and we are effective in providing tools for cardano's further growth. We bundle our developer and ecosystem experiences in the tools we build and maintain, and by that, ensure a high quality of our tools, libraries and guides to the growing developer ecosystem. Our tech stack has become a strong and reliable part of Cardano ecosystem infrastructure empowering and supporting builders in their projects and adventures.
