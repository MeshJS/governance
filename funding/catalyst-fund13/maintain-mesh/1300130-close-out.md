## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

This proposal was submitted in the “Cardano Open: Developers” funding category  
Which had the objective to enable funding to support developers and engineers to contribute to or develop open source technology centered around enabling and improving the Cardano developer experience.  
We addressed this objective through:  
Maintaining and updating the MeshSDK, a well known and widely used open source stack for developers building on Cardano. Mesh provides developers with a wide range of tools and solutions which help them to build easier, faster and safer apps, products and services on the cardano blockchain.  

Mesh improves Dev experience mainly via:  
- well maintained open source stack of a wide range of useful tools & libraries such as tx builder, wallets, smart contracts, providers, etc.  
- developer support on Discord, where we support and help developers through their builder journey, ensuring that devs have the help and support needed to successfully build their projects

## List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

The project KPIs had been stated uniformly throughout all milestones and measured:  
Monthly report on MeshJS github and Discord activities to prove the maintenance and activities of MeshJS. The report includes metrics such as:  
- Number of active GitHub repositories on MeshJS GitHub  
- number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository  

Monthly summary of GitHub repository activities:  
[Number of] authors have pushed [Number of] commits to main and [Number of] commits to all branches. On main, [Number of] files have changed and there have been [Number of] additions and [Number of] deletions  

Active Discord Server  
- Number of active public channels on MeshJS Discord server.  
- Number of private support channels ON MeshJS Discord server.

## Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

This proposal surely was a great success for us and the cardano developer ecosystem, key achievements have been particularly around:

### Projects building on Mesh evolution:  
A total increase of 183 new projects building on Mesh in the timeframe of this proposal.

- February: 626  
- March: 671  
- April: 735  
- May: 800  
- June: 809  

### Monthly downloads of meshsdk npm  
A total of 46,124 downloads of mesh code in the timeframe of this proposal

- February: 7458  
- March: 10635  
- April: 8551  
- May: 8649  
- June: 10831  

### Contributions on meshsdk github repository in the timeframe of this proposal  
474 Commits  
45291 additions  
749 file changes

- February: 78 commits to main and 90 commits to all branches. On main, 128 files have changed and there have been 5,055 additions and 2,571 deletions.  
- March: 93 commits to main and 119 commits to all branches. On main, 245 files have changed and there have been 8,771 additions and 2,212 deletions.  
- April: 103 commits to main and 124 commits to all branches. On main, 161 files have changed and there have been 14,862 additions and 2,771 deletions.  
- May: 60 commits to main and 71 commits to all branches. On main, 103 files have changed and there have been 2,667 additions and 820 deletions.  
- June: 44 commits to main and 70 commits to all branches. On main, 112 files have changed and there have been 13,936 additions and 4,012 deletions.  

### Github Contributors  
During the proposal timeframe, the number of contributors which contribute to the mesh open source stack increased from 37 to 53.  
- February: 37  
- March: 44  
- April: 47  
- May: 49  
- June: 53  

### Discord activity, messages sent per month  
Closing this proposal with a total of 9892 discord messages during the proposal execution  
- February: 1854  
- March: 2146  
- April: 2192  
- May: 2703  
- June: 3,700  

So, summing up everything, Mesh has a relatively high turnout of produced code for the received Ada, a strong number and progress of projects building on Mesh, and a highly active dev community.

## Key learnings

Looking at the achieved success so far, we can definitely draw some relevant learnings. In particular our simple, yet effective setup which enables strong and active contributions to our open-source stack.  

- Github open source repositories  
- Public Discord support channels for devs  

While Github is a commonly used platform for devs to collaborate on projects and its stacks, Discord allows additional topic-focused chats and discussions. Together, Github + Discord provides a simple and effective way to allow developers to contribute while also being able to support builders through their builder journey.  

The funds from this proposal definitely play an important role, since the funding increases motivation and commitments.  

Last but not least, this proposal eventually led to the creation of our first Dashboard, which, in addition to our website and docs provides overview and insights on our doings at Cardano. Since the first Maintain-mesh proposal in Fund10, and its successor proposals in Fund 11, 12 and 13, we were able to identify KPIs and OKRs we should focus on, these learnings provided the initial foundation for the dashboard and while learning step by step to properly report on our progress via the maintain-mesh proposals, we now have a clear set of metrics on which we can report Mesh growth and ecosystem contributions.

## Next steps for the product or service developed

This proposal definitely helped and motivated to further maintain and enhance our open source stack  
As of next steps, we are still planning to move the maintain-mesh proposals away from Project Catalyst to alternative funding sources, especially since the budget allocations for projects like this had been halved from previously 200K Ada available proposal budgets to 100K max budgets a single proposal can request, eventually eliminating our possibility to further fund mesh maintenance meaningfully via project catalyst.  

This is not forcefully a bad thing, since it is a common challenge for open source projects to explore and establish funding sources which enable projects to maintain their open source stack. It is most likely that we will submit an annual maintain-mesh proposal directly at onchain governance.

## Final thoughts/comments

Final thoughts are definitely around two things.

**The Challenges forward**  
As mentioned above, it will be a challenge for us to figure out how we can enable funding to continue the maintenance of our open source projects which we don't want to monetise or put behind a pay wall. We see the Mesh tooling as critical infrastructure which should be open and free for anyone to use. Our strong metrics of projects building on mesh is the best indicator for making the point. Our current thinking is around optimising our Stack towards ai-models, capturing the growing use of ai-models by developers and ensuring that Mesh can be easily used by developers and their ai models to carry out day-to-day coding tasks in a safe, fast and easy way.  

**Big thanks to everyone**  
This proposal would not have been possible without all the heads and hands which helped to make the proposal a success, from voters to reviewers, builders to Catalyst Admin team. A big thanks for everyone who participated in the successful close out of this project.
