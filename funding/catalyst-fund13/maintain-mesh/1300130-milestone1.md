And here the reports on each item:

## MeshJS github repositories & activity
### General Github information
At the date of February, 2025, MeshJS hosts a total of 39 repositories on the MeshJS github from which currently 27 are public open source repositories. 
You can find all public Mesh github repositories under:
https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories.

## MeshJS/mesh
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh 
Our core repository at meshjs/mesh is active and well maintained and we see a healthy increase of projects using our open source code stack to build their own projects, here our core repo in numbers.

### Development pulse
In February 2025, excluding merges, 4 authors have pushed 78 commits to main and 90 commits to all branches. On main, 128 files have changed and there have been 5,055 additions and 2,571 deletions.

### Dependencies 
We have currently 626 dependencies on MeshJS/mesh repository which marks an increase of 35 new projects building with Mesh compared to 591 dependencies in January 2025. These numbers are the best indicator to prove the usefulness of our core repo and we are pretty proud of seeing that much active use of mesh code at the Cardano open source developer ecosystem
You can find all dependencies at: 
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents 
(quite a few well known Cardano projects using our code, nice nice)


## Mesh Discord Server
Same as our github repo’s, our Discord server is kept well active and maintained and we see a constant engagement from developers and our crew who are quick in responding to questions and issues. 

Here the Server activity for February 2025 in numbers.

- Total Number of messages: 1854
- Total Number of visitors: 140
- Total Number of members: 723

Our main public channel, the #ask-team forum stays the main channel to answer questions to developers. We have a current count of 95 discussions on the forum, which marks an increase of 23 discussions compared to 72 discussions in January 2025.



Since the Milestone reviewers of the previous maintain-mesh proposal from Fund12 stated their appreciation on Mesh sharing Discord server insight screenshot-videos, we continue providing that since it helps you to assess.

## And that's it… for this month
Overall, very glad to see the mesh machine running smoothly and steadily. We see increased number of projects using our open source code, have the capacities to always update and maintain developer tooling and see a growing developer community on our Discord. Since our debut in 2022, we have gained a quite strong reputation in the developer ecosystem since many directly benefit from our work, we build active collaborations and engagements with other cardano builder projects and have become a well orchestrated place for newcomers as well as veterans who want to build on Cardano.
