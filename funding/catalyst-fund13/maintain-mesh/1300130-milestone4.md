Hey there Milestone reviewers :)
Here we are once again, reporting on the successful continuation of the proposal and completion of our 4th Milestone covering MeshJS maintenance for May 2025. 

Our stated milestone outcomes and acceptance criteria has been stated as:

- Monthly report on MeshJS github and Discord activities to prove the maintenance and activities of MeshJS. The report includes metrics such as:
-- Number of active GitHub repositories on MeshJS GitHub
-- number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository
- Monthly summary of GitHub repository activities:
-- [Number of] authors have pushed [Number of] commits to main and [Number of] commits to all branches. On main, [Number of] files have changed and there have been [Number of] additions and [Number of] deletions
- Active Discord Server
-- Number of active public channels on MeshJS Discord server.
-- Number of private support channels ON MeshJS Discord server.

And here the reports on each item:

## MeshJS github repositories & activity
MeshJS/mesh
Our core repository at meshjs/mesh is as usual very active and well maintained and we see a healthy increase of projects using our open source code stack to build their own projects, here our core repo in numbers.
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh

In May 2025,  Excluding merges, 9 authors have pushed 60 commits to main and 71 commits to all branches. On main, 103 files have changed and there have been 2,667 additions and 820 deletions.

## Dependencies

Continuing to reflecting monthly growth we see that we have a constant and stable growth of builders using mesh for their projects. These numbers are a nice indicator to prove the usefulness of our core repo and we are pretty proud of seeing that much active and constant use of mesh code at the Cardano open source developer ecosystem 

Projects building on Mesh:
- January: 591
- February: 626
- March: 671
- April: 735
