And here the reports on each item:

## MeshJS github repositories & activity

### MeshJS/mesh
Our core repository at meshjs/mesh is active and well maintained and we see a healthy increase of projects using our open source code stack to build their own projects, here our core repo in numbers.

https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh

In March 2025, excluding merges, 6 authors have pushed 93 commits to main and 119 commits to all branches. On main, 245 files have changed and there have been 8,771 additions and 2,212 deletions.

### Dependencies
We have currently 671 dependencies on MeshJS/mesh repository which marks an increase of 45 new projects in March 2025, compared to 626 dependencies in February 2025. These numbers are the best indicator to prove the usefulness of our core repo and we are pretty proud of seeing that much active use of mesh code at the Cardano open source developer ecosystem You can find all dependencies at: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents 

(quite a few well known Cardano projects using our code, nice nice)

### Downloads
Introducing a new metric to measure success, we start to track weekly and monthly downloads of our code via https://www.npmjs.com/package/@meshsdk/core where we see a strong number of currently 2450 downloads per week, 

### More Mesh in Numbers
To further improve on measuring Mesh sdk success we started to pull some relevant data together from npmjs and github on a own page to have a better overview and access to Mesh metrics.

### Mesh Discord Server
Same as our github repo’s, our Discord server is kept well active and maintained and we see a constant engagement from developers and our crew who are quick in responding to questions and issues.

Here the Server activity for March 2025 in numbers.

- Total Number of messages: 2146
- Total Number of visitors: 136
- Total Number of members:727
- 
Our main public channel, the #ask-team forum stays the main channel to answer questions to developers. We have a current count of 130 discussions on the forum, which marks an increase of 45 discussions compared to 95 discussions in February 2025.

Since the Milestone reviewers of the previous maintain-mesh proposal from Fund12 stated their appreciation on Mesh sharing Discord server insight screenshot-videos, we continue providing that since it helps you to assess.

### And that's it… for this month
Overall, very glad to see the mesh machine running smoothly and steadily. We see an increased number of projects using our open source code, have the capacities to always update and maintain developer tooling and see a growing developer community on our Discord.

We hope that you like the additional data we added to measure mesh success metrics, also, for any feedback or ideas on how to further improve our reporting, feel free to leave us your ideas and suggestions via this form
