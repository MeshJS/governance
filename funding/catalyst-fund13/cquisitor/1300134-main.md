[METADATA] Horizons
Developer Tools
[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution
We aim to enhance Mesh Devtools by migrating existing features and integrating robust Rust modules for validation, error handling, and transaction debugging. This will improve user experience and provide developers with meaningful feedback to accelerate their work with Cardano.

How we do it…

Feature Migration & Compatibility

Migrate all Cquisitor features to the Mesh Devtools website.
Update dependencies to ensure feature completion and compatibility with Chang.
Rust Module Development for Validation

Develop a Rust module for partial phase-1 validation.
Identify common validation issues and define clear error messages.
Provide explanations and hints to help developers resolve errors.
Extend Rust module for Plutus Script execution (phase-2).
Mesh.js Integration And Enhanced Error Messaging

Integrating partial phase-1 and phase-2 validation modules with Mesh.js.
Detailed error messages from phase 1 to phase 2 validation on Mesh.js for better debugging insights.
Documentation & Project Close-out

Update Mesh.js documentation.
Create a final project report and a close-out video.
[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community
Accelerated Development for Builders

By migrating Cquisitor features and integrating advanced Rust modules, developers will have access to more efficient tools that reduce time spent on troubleshooting and validation. This will encourage faster project delivery and innovation on Cardano.

Improved Error Debugging and User Guidance

With enhanced error handling, developers will receive meaningful and actionable feedback. Instead of struggling to interpret cryptic error messages, they will get clear explanations and suggestions for resolving issues. This will reduce the learning curve for new developers and enhance productivity for seasoned ones.

Greater Adoption of Cardano Tools

The project’s focus on seamless integration with Mesh Devtools and the Aiken-Uplc framework for Plutus script execution will encourage more developers to adopt Cardano-native solutions. This will foster a stronger developer ecosystem around Cardano, enabling broader use cases to be built on the blockchain.

[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
MeshJS is one of the open source libraries with highest quality in the Cardano ecosystem. Our previous work is the best and most sincere argument to showcase that we have been constantly delivering our promises since inception and we have an inside out knowledge on Cardano and software development in all domains of Cardano dApp development. We understand what users and developers need and have a strong track record which undermines our competency in the field

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
Cost Efficiency through Tool Enhancement

By migrating existing features to Mesh Devtools and developing Rust-based validation modules, the project will significantly reduce the time and effort developers spend troubleshooting. This increased efficiency translates to savings for developers and projects, as they will be able to complete their work faster with fewer resources. In the long run, the upfront cost of development leads to reduced operational costs for the entire ecosystem.

Reusable and Open-Source Tools

The open-source nature of the project means that the tools and solutions developed will be available for the entire community to use and build upon. This not only maximizes the utility of the project for current developers but also ensures long-term value, as future projects will be able to leverage these resources without incurring additional costs.

Increased Developer Productivity and Innovation

By delivering a smoother development experience—particularly through better validation processes and more meaningful error feedback—the project empowers developers to focus on creating innovative solutions rather than spending time resolving technical issues. This productivity boost will result in a higher volume of quality projects being built on Cardano, which enhances the overall value of the ecosystem.
