Milestone 1 Report


Hello Milestone Reviewers and anyone else following up with the progress of the proposal.

We are definitely a bit after the initial schedule, mainly due to running into quite load of challenges and issues (sometimes things are harder than we think indeed) as well as having sometimes too much to do. Anyway, here we are, reporting on the successful completion of the first milestone.



The milestone outcomes have been stated as:

- Completed Development: Migrate all cquisitor features to Mesh Devtools website
- Completed Development: Update the dependency which make cquisitor feature complete and chang compatible
- Public links to the code on mesh github repository
- Public link to open source license on mesh github

---

And here the deliverables, ready for your review.

All cquisitor features are migrated to Mesh devtools website, dependencies have been updated to get cquisitor ready and chang-compatible, everything is now up and running, ready for developers at:
https://cloud.meshjs.dev/cquisitor
