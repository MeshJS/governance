### List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The proposal was submitted in the Project Catalyst Fund13, "Cardano Open: Developers" funding category, the category KPI have been stated as:
- Standardize, develop, support, or provide utilities for full stack solutions and integrated development environments 
- Create new libraries, SDKs, publicly available APIs, toolchains and frameworks 

Our proposal addressed these via:
- Enhancing Mesh Devtools by migrating features, developing Rust-based validation modules, and improving error handling to provide clearer feedback, helping developers debug and validate efficiently

### List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

Our project KPIs had been stated as:

Feature Migration & Compatibility
- Migrate all Cquisitor features to the Mesh Devtools website.
- Update dependencies to ensure feature completion and compatibility with Chang

Rust Module Development for Validation
- Develop a Rust module for partial phase-1 validation.
- Identify common validation issues and define clear error messages.
- Provide explanations and hints to help developers resolve errors.
- Extend Rust module for Plutus Script execution (phase-2).

Mesh.js Integration And Enhanced Error Messaging
- Integrating partial phase-1 and phase-2 validation modules with Mesh.js.
- Detailed error messages from phase 1 to phase 2 validation on Mesh.js for better debugging insights.

Documentation & Project Close-out
- Update Mesh.js documentation.
- Create a final project report and a close-out video.


All KPIs have been addressed through our respective Proposal Milestone deliverables where we had a total of 5 Milestones which packaged all our work and execution. At the time of writing this report, all Milestones which focused on the development of Cquisitor have been successfully delivered, reviewed and approved.

### Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)
Key achievements of this proposal can be summarized such as:

Successful development completion
( in addition to achieved KPIs at “List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them”)
Without the actual completion of the development, no other success criteria could have been achieved, hence the first and foremost key achievement is to have fully completed all development activities and the launch of the tool to the public

Successful Proposal execution
Besides the development, the completion of the respective catalyst proposal administration is key to allow us the final completion and report of the project. We are glad that all processes, from submission, to onboarding and to milestone reporting have been smooth and successful.

Grow Cardano’s Open Source Stack
With the completion of Cquisitor, we add an additional open source tool to the Cardano ecosystem and are glad to see the cardano open source ecosystem growing by another helpful tool the community has asked for. 

### Key learnings

Deeper understanding of Cardano transaction validation
During the development process, we gained a much clearer understanding of how transaction validation works within the Cardano blockchain. We explored the mechanisms behind script execution and the validation phases that ensure correctness of transactions.

Integration between Rust-WASM and JavaScript
We learned a lot about the practical aspects and challenges of integrating Rust-compiled WebAssembly modules with JavaScript applications. This included managing memory between the two environments and designing clean interfaces for seamless communication across the boundary.

### Next steps for the product or service developed
As of next steps for Cquisitor:
We see that Cquisitor is a nice and effective tool which helps developers and we will continue to maintain and further enhance the tool. Furthermore, the development of Cquisitor brought us to initial ideations around the general approach and setup at Mesh for specific tools such as Cquisitor where we currently think in the direction of a Mesh Platform and tool integrations to have a less scattered and more harmonised setup for devs using Mesh stack & tools. 

Further ideas with Evgenii Lisitskii (Lead Developer and Cquisitor idea author) have brought up ideas of merging the tool with other specific dev tools such as DE-UPLC to further enhance and level up Mesh dev-tools.

So yes, one can surely count on us in further leveling up not only Cquisitor, but the Mesh dev tools in general, stay tuned :).

### Final thoughts/comments

Since Catalyst couldn't run without its voters, reviewers and administrators, a big thanks and shoutout to everyone who engaged in transforming this proposal into reality. We deeply appreciate the received support and
