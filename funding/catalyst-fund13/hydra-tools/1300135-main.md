[METADATA] Horizons
Developer Tools
[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution
Despite hydras potential, there is currently lacking engagement on further development and enhancement to already existing hydra functionalities. Mesh, recognises the gap and aims to provide tooling to further enrich hydra functionality.

This proposal aims to:

Implement hydra Provider to connect with a Hydra node
Enable functions outlining Hydra processes at different stages
Setup Hydra Provider to fully interact with a Hydra node
Enable linking to Hydra API documentation
Deploy simple webpage that shows balance in a head and can create & sign transactions using a CIP-30 wallet
Develop TxBuilder who can be started for Hydra settings
Setup working Hydra Asteria (https://github.com/txpipe/asteria) integrated with Mesh
Update meshjs documentation to help users start building on Hydra
As in our tradition, all proposal outcomes will be fully open source.

[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community
By advancing hydra functionalities, we aim to contribute and boost hydra impact cases such as:

Scalability: Hydra is a layer-2 scaling solution for Cardano, allowing the network to handle more transactions per second (TPS) without overloading the main chain. This increases throughput and reduces congestion during high-traffic periods.

Cost Efficiency: By handling transactions off-chain and only settling the final results on the main chain, Hydra reduces transaction costs. This makes Cardano more attractive for developers and users, especially in applications that require high transaction volumes, like DeFi.

Faster Transactions: Hydra enables near-instant finality for transactions within a Hydra head, significantly speeding up the transaction process compared to the main chain.

Enhanced Developer Experience: Integrating Hydra with Mesh, along with updated documentation, makes it easier for developers to build and scale applications on Cardano. Simplified tooling lowers the barrier to entry, encouraging more developers to work on Cardano.

[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
Trust and accountability:

MeshJS is one of the open source libraries with highest quality tooling in the Cardano ecosystem. Our previous work is the best and most sincere argument to showcase that we have been constantly delivering our promises since inception.

Feasibility:

MeshJS team has inside out knowledge on Cardano and software development in all domains of Cardano DApp development. We understand what users and developers need and have a strong track record which undermines our competency.

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
Building Open-Source Tooling to Enhance Hydra's Usability and Adoption

Our goal is to deliver value from multiple perspectives by creating open-source tools that enhance Hydra's functionality and accessibility.

Enhancing the Developer Experience

The current lack of Hydra-based projects is largely due to the limited tooling, currently available for developers. By providing robust tools, we can simplify the development process and making it easier for developers to build applications on Hydra.

Advancing Hydra’s Capabilities

Contributing to Hydra’s ongoing development enriches its features and maximizes its potential. This not only improves the protocol but ideally also helps the community to unlock new opportunities through Hydra’s enhanced functionality.
