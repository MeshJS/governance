### Name of project manager
Jingles

### Date project started
February 2025

### Date project completed
October 2025

### List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The proposal was submitted in the Project Catalyst Fund13, "Cardano Open: Developers" funding category, the category KPI have been stated as:
- Standardize, develop, support, or provide utilities for full stack solutions and integrated development environments 
- Create new libraries, SDKs, publicly available APIs, toolchains and frameworks 
- Governance and blockchain interoperability tooling

Our proposal addressed these via:
- Provide open source & docs tools for developers to integration Hydra to enable end-user operations like interacting with wallet, query UTXOs/balance and submit transactions and additional helpful functions

### List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

Our project KPIs had been stated as:
- Hydra Provider integrated with a Hydra node
- Hydra Provider fully communicates with a Hydra node (open, commit, close, fanout phases)
- Reference to Hydra API documentation integrated
- Web app showing balance in Hydra head & allowing CIP-30 wallet transactions
- TxBuilder configured for Hydra constants
- Hydra Asteria working setup with Mesh
- Updated MeshJS docs for Hydra integration
- Public links to all deliverables (code, docs, report, video)

All KPIs have been addressed through our respective Proposal Milestone deliverables where we had a total of 5 Milestones which packaged all our work and execution. At the time of writing this report, all Milestones have been succesfully deliivered, reviewed and approved.

### Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

Key achivements of this proposal has been:

- Established Hydra Provider integration to connect with Hydra nodes
- Developed foundational functions for all key Hydra phases (Open, Commit, Close, Fanout)
- Created complete Hydra package available on GitHub and NPM (@meshsdk/hydra)
- Deployed fully functional Hydra Provider with complete node communication
- Built web demo with Hydra head balance display and CIP-30 wallet integration
- Successfully integrated Asteria with Mesh framework
- Provided head operation logs and demonstrations
- Created dedicated GitHub repository (github.com/MeshJS/asteria) with Apache 2.0 license
- Created comprehensive documentation with API reference and usage instructions
- Developed setup guide and instructions at hydra-asteria.vercel.app/how-to-play

### Key learnings

Key learnings can be stated such as.

1) Developer learning
The Mesh developer, a young developer who just finished his university exama states his personal learnings as:
- Learned interacting hydra-head with a smart contract transaction.
- Learned navigating on how to mint and safely burn token in hydra head close. (In-view)
- Learning on hydra reference script bug (creating an issue for it)
- learned on how to make UTxO work with hydra UTxO format I.e the cli style.
- learned more about websocket connections
- also some functions like evaluators are not available on hydra as fees are not needed if needed they are manually calculated.
- also came across a lot of failing errors that would be easier to guide anyone new and solve those errors quickly. - this is so important for me.
  
2) General Mesh Learnings
As Mesh at general, key learnings can be stated as:
- strong positive feedback from our dev community, encouraging and motivating us to continue working on Hydra Tooling
- Advanced Hydra tooling is still lacking and we indeed once again got acknowledged how relevant tooling is to unlock Cardano technology potentials
- Project Catalyst proven to be once again a awesome place ti kick off new projects and initiatives and to enable funds for projects with valid ideas on how to improve the ecosystem

### Next steps for the product or service developed
We keep working on Mesh - Hydra open source tooling for developers since we recognise the potential and need of better tooling for developers building with Hydra.
Mesh Hydra development will stay a active development branch within Mesh, the developer leading the proposal execution is now general owner of Mesh Hydra and we can expect follow up development and maintenance to ensure that developer using Mesh can keep using our stack when building Cardano L2 Scaling solutions.

### Final thoughts/comments
Besides our tooling, we also recognised recurring questions from Builders who open discussions on our Discord Server where we are able to provide guidance and support, once again showcasing how important direct devv support besides our open source stack is to help builders through their journey. This proposal was a great initiative to build up Mesh-Hydra specific tooling, definitley not a dead-end. Thanks for everyone who supported this proposal, from developers to voters, Milestone Reviewers and for sure the Catalyst Team.
