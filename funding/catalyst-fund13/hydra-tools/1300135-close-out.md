### List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The proposal was submitted in the Project Catalyst Fund13, "Cardano Open: Developers" funding category, the category KPI have been stated as:
- Standardize, develop, support, or provide utilities for full stack solutions and integrated development environments 
- Create new libraries, SDKs, publicly available APIs, toolchains and frameworks 
- Governance and blockchain interoperability tooling

Our proposal addressed these via:
- Provide open source & docs tools for developers to integration Hydra to enable end-user operations like interacting with wallet, query UTXOs/balance and submit transactions and additional helpful functions

### List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

Our project KPIs had been stated as:
- Hydra Provider integrated with a Hydra node
- Hydra Provider fully communicates with a Hydra node (open, commit, close, fanout phases)
- Reference to Hydra API documentation integrated
- Web app showing balance in Hydra head & allowing CIP-30 wallet transactions
- TxBuilder configured for Hydra constants
- Hydra Asteria working setup with Mesh
- Updated MeshJS docs for Hydra integration
- Public links to all deliverables (code, docs, report, video)

All KPIs have been addressed through our respective Proposal Milestone deliverables where we had a total of 5 Milestones which packaged all our work and execution. At the time of writing this report, all Milestones have been succesfully deliivered, reviewed and approved.

### Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

Key achivements of this proposal has been:

- Established Hydra Provider integration to connect with Hydra nodes
- Developed foundational functions for all key Hydra phases (Open, Commit, Close, Fanout)
- Created complete Hydra package available on GitHub and NPM (@meshsdk/hydra)
- Deployed fully functional Hydra Provider with complete node communication
- Built web demo with Hydra head balance display and CIP-30 wallet integration
- Successfully integrated Asteria with Mesh framework
- Provided head operation logs and demonstrations
- Created dedicated GitHub repository (github.com/MeshJS/asteria) with Apache 2.0 license
- Created comprehensive documentation with API reference and usage instructions
- Developed setup guide and instructions at hydra-asteria.vercel.app/how-to-play

### Key learnings

### Next steps for the product or service developed
We keep working on Mesh - Hydra open source tooling for developers since we recognise the potential and need of better tooling for developers building with Hydra.
Mesh Hydra development will stay a active development branch within Mesh, the developer leading the proposal execution is now general owner of Mesh Hydra and we can expect follow up development and maintenance to ensure that developer using Mesh can keep using our stack when building Cardano L2 Scaling solutions.

### Final thoughts/comments
Besides our tooling, we also recognised recurring questions from Builders who open discussions on our Discord Server where we are able to provide guidance and support, once again showcasing how important
