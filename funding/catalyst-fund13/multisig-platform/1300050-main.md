Context (Important)

Around September 2024, we started to develop a Multisig tool at Mesh, from early development we saw the potential to build a more complex multisig platform, tailor-made to the needs and wants of the cardano ecosystem engaged in its onchain governance. If we want to ensure high-quality governance, we have to ensure that we have the right tools to make it easy for anyone to engage. That said, we also saw that our ideas on what the multisig platform could become had a barrier. We simply don't have all the needed dev time and capacity at Mesh which we would like to have to further push on all the ideas of the multisig.

So, we did what we do… collaborating with builders. We decided to ask other Cardano Builder projects if they would be interested in joining forces and to team up to help the development of the multisig, we reached out to ClarityDAO and Fluidtokens and got a great response from both. So, here we are, 3 Projects teaming up, for each of the 3 the full project would be too much, but effectively sharing workload amongst each other reallly makes the deal, sharing direct access to each other's dev power while at the same time minimizing workload for each and wrapping everything into a proposal to ensure budget allocations seems a quite effective way to further develop the multisig platform.

How we want to build it.

We take a simple and straightforward approach:

Each project focuses on different project features
All features are grouped into Milestones
Each Milestone and its budget is assigned to a project responsible for delivering the milestone outcomes
This should allow us to have an easy deal in coordinating workloads and budgets, and to build a tool with rich features collaboratively, contributing to the Cardano open source environment, and supporting the community at onchain governance. 

The Tool

The multisig tool at the current stage already allows to:

Connect Wallet
Create a onchain multisig wallet
Assign multiple signers
Define decision quorum
Send/Receive transactions
Register DRep certificate
This is a solid start, yet, we really want to build the best out of it, so the additional features we want to develop in collaboration with Mesh, ClarityDAO & Fluidtokens are:

- vote governance actions

- submit governance actions

- view governance actions

- delegate to DRep page

- UI UX for teams and DAO operations

- ADA handle lookup

- discord integration, to ping people to sign

- support tokens native assets

- loan request or instant liquidity with Fluidtokens Tokens

- perform swap on Minswap

- new account type, based on Plutus script, to involve the community to participate in transactions and votes

All together, building a sophisticated and easy-to-use multisig platform for the everyday user to get engaged in Cardano governance as groups and collectives.

[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community
By building a fancy & powerful multisig, we mainly aim to bring impact on:

Cardano Governance

Easy-to-use tool, even for non techies to manage a multisig wallet on cardano with features which allow a multisig full access to all on chain governance processes, propose, review and vote, delegate, swap or lend assets.. All within a simple interface. This will help to bring governance to the people in a seamless way, increasing participation and active governance engagements overall. 
Open Source Developer Ecosystem

Building a powerful governance tool in direct collaboration and open sourcing the tool is a powerful statement itself, and ideally not only adds a rich resource to the already existing cardano open source ecosystem, but also allows others to benefit from our work, to build upon our achievements and to invite anyone to contribute to the open source stack of the project. Ideally, we push the narrative and importance of having high-quality and open-source governance tools for Cardano, encouraging and supporting other builders and ensuring that knowledge is given in the hands of many.
[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
All of the 3 projects collaborating in this initiative are well-experienced cardano builder projects. Mesh, ClarityDAO and Fluidtokens all share a deep commitment to the Cardano ecosystem and all of us have been overly engaged contributors in Cardano for many years. All together, we have all the needed skills and capabilities to successfully implement the proposal.

[RESOURCES] Who is in the project team and what are their roles?
Project: Mesh

https://meshjs.dev/ 

An experienced and well-established open-source Project in the Cardano developer community. We build high-quality tooling, libraries and guides to support builders in developing Cardano applications. 

Proposal role: In this proposal, Mesh takes charge of Milestone 1, Milestone 4 and Milestone 5 as well as coordinating the overall proposal.

Project: ClarityDAO

https://www.clarity.community/ 

Clarity is a community management and DAO management platform. Clarity provides infrastructure for Cardano projects to manage community treasuries, community governance, community engagement, and community rewards. Clarity is keen to contribute to open source development of useful tools for the Cardano Ecosystem.

Decentralization has become a powerful tool for communities and organizations seeking greater control, transparency, and flexibility in how they operate. While DAOs are a popular gateway to this new frontier, decentralization is about more than just forming a DAO — it’s about fundamentally reshaping how communities collaborate and make decisions.

At Clarity, we help communities move beyond traditional structures and embrace the next level of decentralization. Whether you’re forming a DAO or looking to adopt decentralized principles, our tools and expertise are designed to elevate your community’s governance and engagement. Decentralization isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, and we’re here to tailor it to your unique vision, helping you thrive in this new era of collective empowerment.

Proposal role: In this proposal, ClarityDAO takes charge of Milestone 2

Project: Fluid Tokens

https://linktr.ee/fluidtokens 

Fluid Tokens is the current leading ecosystem on Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains that leverages your assets to offer a world of innovative financial services. This open, trustless and secure ecosystem offers different non-custodial DeFi services for any crypto user, created following the community needs and feedbacks

Proposal role: In this proposal, Fluidtokens takes charge of Milestone 3

[BUDGET & COSTS] Please provide a cost breakdown of the proposed work and resources
Milestone 1 Budget: 100.000 ADA, assigned to Mesh

Milestone 2 Budget: 100.000 ADA assigned to ClarityDAO

Milestone 3 Budget: 100.000 ADA assigned to Fluidtokens

Milestone 4 Budget: 100.000 ADA assigned to Mesh

Milestone 5 Budget: 100.000 ADA assigned to everyone, to be kept for additional or unforeseen work.

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
The value for money can be seen from many perspectives.

The collaboration itself.
Since we started to develop the multisig at Mesh, we saw that we don't have all the required dev time available to really move the tool quickly forward. Building project-based collaborations with other builder projects (in our case with ClarityDAO & Fluidtokens) allows this project to diverse project workload amongst the collaborators while enabling additional dev capacities. All that, while ensuring that we develop the tool on the highest quality standards and expectations. Teamwork makes the dream work sort of ^^

Open-source Governance Tooling
Cardano is in full swing into onchain governance, a topic which impacts the whole ecosystem. As a community, we rely on high quality tooling able to support governance activities. Building valuable tools which are built from the community for the community and which are open source ensures that knowledge is given in the hands of many, and not closed to some few.
