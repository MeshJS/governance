# Milestone3 Report

Proposal: Cardano Multisig Platform by Mesh, Clarity DAO & FluidTokens
- https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1300050 



Hey there Milestone Reviewers, voters and really anyone who follows the progress of this proposal.
Here we are, reporting on the successful completion of the third proposal milestone. Took once again a bit longer than expected but we finally got everything done. So, here we are.

The acceptance criteria for this milestone has been stated as:

- Completed feature loan request or instant liquidity with Fluidtokens
- Completed feature to swap on Minswap


And here is the report on the deliveries.

- Completed feature loan request or instant liquidity with FluidTokens
The feature loan request by FluidTokens has been successfully completed and deployed

- Completed feature to swap on Minswap
The feature to swap funds on Minswap by FluidTokens has been successfully completed and deployed

Both deliverables have been completed by Fluidtoken. To make it easier to add and deploy features on the multisig, we enabled an API through which fluidtoken has deployed their features.

The respective Multisig API has been introduced with this Pull Request:
- https://github.com/MeshJS/multisig/pull/97 

Additionally documentation for the publicly available API can be found at:
- https://multisig.meshjs.dev/api-docs

A respective github repo at FluidTokens outlining the use of the deployed features can be found at:
- https://github.com/FluidTokens/ft-mesh-aquarium-demo 

In addition, here a video from FluidTokens giving a run-through of their successfully deployed features

The project is since inception fully open source, accessible and free to use for anyone
Repository: https://github.com/MeshJS/multisig 
Open source licence: https://github.com/MeshJS/multisig?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme 

### Other mentions.
Besides the envisioned deliveries, we also had a few features we shipped along the way while completing Milestone 3 which came up and had been addressed anyway, such as:

Voting ballots:
Allows Multisig DRep to create and sign voting ballots on multiple governance actions
- https://github.com/MeshJS/multisig/pull/123 

UI/UX improvements:
Especially on the mobile version side, making the multisig more mobile friendly
- https://github.com/MeshJS/multisig/pull/110

And that's it, glad that everything has been done. 
We are actively working on the deliverables of the next milestone. Special thanks to FluidTokens for a smooth and nice collaboration on this milestone.

See you soon
