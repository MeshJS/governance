### List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The challenge KPIs of the Fund13: Cardano Use-Cases category have been stated as:
- Active users and usage growth of the existing product
- Number and volume of Cardano on-chain transactions generated
- Degree of Cardano-native integration (Plutus, native assets, UTxO design, scaling solutions)
- New or extended product features delivered using Cardano
- Increase in Cardano ecosystem adoption (new users, projects, or use cases enabled)

  
We addressed these by further developing the open source Mesh Multisignature Wallet for the Cardano ecosystem and to team up with Fluidtoken & ClarityDAO in implement user friendly DeFi enhancements, making it easy, fast and effective for Ada holders to manage funds and onchain governance engagements via multisignature wallets.


### List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

Our Project KPIs have been defined as stated via specific Milestone achievements.

Milestone 1: DRep as Multisig.
The initial Milestone and KPIs focused on establishing technical solutions for DReps which are managed as a team. Allowing users to create DReps as multisig accounts, submitting votes and managing funds as a team.

- Completed multisig feature to vote on governance actions
- Completed multisig feature to register as DRep
- Completed multisig feature to view governance actions
- Completed multisig feature to delegate to DRep

Milestone 2:
The second Milestone and its KPIs focused on integrations with ClarityDAO solutions which integrated the multisig into ClarityDAO toolstack.

- Completed UI/UX for team and DAO operations
- Completed ADA Handle lookup
- Completed discord integration to ping people to sign
- Completed multisig support for cardano tokens/native assets

Milestone 3:
The third milestone was in collaboration with Fluidtokens and went through the integration of DeFi features, allowing multisig wallets to engage in Cardano DeFi.

- Completed feature loan request or instant liquidity with Fluidtokens
- Completed feature to swap on Minswap

Milestone 4:
The fourth Milestone added a plutus script version to the initial native script DRep as multisig, allowing more common setup for DReps and better interoperability with other governance tools & explorers.
  
Completed new account type, based on Plutus script, to involve the community to participate in transactions and votes

The last wto Milestones focus on the wrap up of the project and on the creation of user support resources and open sourcing the multisig stack. 

Milestone 5:
- Completed video recording to showcase all new features
- Licensed the tool and its features under an open source license on a public GitHub repository
- Complete an easy step by step guide for users to use the multisig

Milestone 6:
- Final closeout report is publicly available
- Final closeout video is publicly available

All Milestones have been successfully completed, all our KPIs have ben met and even over delivered.

### Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

Key achievements of this project have been:

1. Successfully complete and report all Milestone deliverables
The most important achievement is surely that we were able to build and ship all proposal deliverables, additionally also shipping some nice features which were not stated in the proposal and were shipped anyway. Doing some more work usually doesn't harm a project, even if it extends the original scope and budget.

2. Successfully collaborate with Fluidtokens & ClarityDAO to ship governance & DeFi enhancements
Mesh has a pretty neat yet small developer crew and there is just that much one can do. In order to extend our capacities, we teamed up with Fluidtokens & ClarityDAO to join the proposal and to take ownership and responsibility to build and ship features which would have been out of scope for our own dev crew. The collaboration with Fluidtokens & ClarityDAO was a nice and smooth experience and all outcomes have been achieved nicely. 

2. Open Source the multisig code base on github, allowing other builders to build upon our stack
Mesh has a strong commitment to open source, the goal was from the beginning to open source out Multisignature stack to the developer community. An active Apache 2.0 open source licence on github ensures that any builder or project can check and verify the product, as well as using the stack for their own purpose and build upon our initial foundations.


### Key learnings

Key learnings can be summarised as:

1. Having Project Catalyst as a place for builders to access needed resources to build and ship open source tools & products has been once again a great opportunity. Proper reporting and building on publicly accessible platforms allows voters to which we are accountable to, to check and verify our work. Since many voters seem to not find their way to the respective Catalyst Milestone portal, we made sure to include the Multisig proposal on our Mesh dashboard from which anyone has easy access to check and assess our work. We indeed believe that proper reporting and building-in-public is a key for funded proposers, hopefully that's a key learning not only for us.

2. Collaboration is often difficult, especially for Project who never worked together in the past. Therefore, we are very glad that our collaboration with ClarityDAO and Fluidtokens has been such a smooth and effective journey. Key learning here is definitely that both ClarityDAO & Fluidtokens did not have to build anything really new, rather integrating their already existing solutions into the Multisig was probably the key which made this collaboration such a smooth and fine success.


### Next steps for the product or service developed

As of next steps, we will continue to maintain the multisig and consistently improve and advance the stack whereby main focus would be first on building a better infrastructure, moving away from supabase & vercel. We also applied to the Intersect maintainer program to access some funding for ongoing maintenance of the open source Multisig wallet. Furthermore, our recent collaboration with SIDAN Lab on Nomos is likely to integrate the multisig into cgov, a new cardano governance platform in the making. Further integrations to Midnight and other upcoming Cardano Partnerchains also could become a viable direction to ensure the multisig travels with Cardano users across the Cardano ecosystems.

### Final thoughts/comments

Final thoughts… the product is very much build and a solid V1 is no shipped. Guess we will now mainly focus on getting the word out so people & projects make use of the free tool. 
We also want to thank everyone involved in this proposal. From devs, to voters to reviewers from which everyone played their part and made this project a successful project.
