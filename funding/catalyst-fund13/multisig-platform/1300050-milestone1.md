# Milestone Report

Hey there Milestone Reviewer, voters and everyone following the progress of this proposal.
We are glad to report on the successful completion of our first Milestone.

The acceptance criteria of this milestone has been stated as:
- ability for users to vote governance actions
- ability for users to register DRep
- ability for users to view governance actions
- ability for users to delegate to DRep page

And here is the evidence of Milestone completion, including all relevant links to assess and audit our work.

- Completed feature for users to vote on onchain Governance Actions
  
Users can submit voting transactions as multisig directly within the Multisig platform, once the vote tx is submitted by a multisig signer, a notification at the multisig wallet lets other signers know about their required signing of the vote tx. The vote is only submitted onchain once the quorum of the multisig signers has been reached.
Feature live and accessible at:
https://multisig.meshjs.dev/ 

- Completed feature for user to access and view submitted onchain Governance Actions
  
Users are able to view and access submitted onchain Governance Actions by accessing the Governance tab within the multisig platform.

(user must be logged in via “connect wallet” in order to access)


- Completed feature for user to issue onchain DRep certificate
  
Users are able to directly mint a onchain DRep certificate with the multisig, allowing groups to register as DRep and to engage at Cardano Governance.	
The registration can be easily done via accessing the “governance” tab

- Completed feature for user to delegate to DRep’s
  
Users are now able to view and delegate their multisig directly to a DRep via the multisig platform

## Else

- Proudly over-delivering…
Since we started hacking around the platform already before the onboarding process for this proposal took place, we gained quite some time which we used to ship some additional features from which we hope to be helpful for users.
