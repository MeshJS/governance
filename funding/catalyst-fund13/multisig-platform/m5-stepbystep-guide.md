5. Add Signers & Quorum
At this step you can add signers to your multisig wallet, how much is up to you, there is not really a upper limit.
You can either ask the signers for their egular wallet addr1 through which they can sign in, or use the invite link and send it over to them
Save the setting with all addresses from the signers you want to have at the multisig, then ->

Then to the quorum which defines how many signers have to sign in order to approve a transaction, you can set the quorum however you want
