# Milestone Report

Hey there Milestone reviewers :)
Here we are again, reporting on the successful completion of our third Milestone covering MeshJS tech & community maintenance for November 2024. Our stated milestone outcomes and acceptance criteria has been stated as:
Monthly report on MeshJS github and Discord activities to proof the maintenance and activities of MeshJS. The report includes metrics such as:
- Number of active GitHub repositories on MeshJS GitHub
number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository
Monthly summary of GitHub repository activities:
Active Discord Server
- Number of active public channels on MeshJS Discord server.
- Number of private support channels ON MeshJS Discord server.
  
So, here is the report on each item.
MeshJS github repositories:
At the date of November 30 2024, MeshJS host a total of 38 repositories on the MeshJS github from which currently 29 are public repositories while 9 repos are still under development and not open to public yet
https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories.
This adds 3 new repositories to the previous month with 35 repositories.

Number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository
At the date of November 30 2024, MeshJS hosts a total of 24 repositories under Apache 2.0 open source licences. You can find all open source repositories at the same link as above at:
https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories 

Repository activities, November 2024
We look on the repositories which receive currently most attention on development:
Github repository: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh 
Excluding merges, 9 authors have pushed 84 commits to main and 105 commits to all branches. On main, 199 files have changed and there have been [24,314 additions and 13,568 deletions]([url](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/compare/673d35c3f06f376cad045ecac4b86e5a7daaf652...main))

It may be relevant to mention that we have more than 500 dependencies from builder projects using our open source tooling at @MeshJS/mesh.

Active Discord Server, November 2024
Our MeshJS Discord server stays home to all kinds of developer communications and coordinations. At the time of writing, we host a total of:
Public Channels: 5
Private Channels: 16 (no addition to last month)

The most active public channel stays the “ask-team” channel where we see very lively engagements from newcomers as well as well seasoned cardano veteran developers.
Yup, overall a very active Discord server which helps us greatly to manage a whole bunch of communications and coordinations across all MeshJS worksides. 
The link to our Discord server: https://discord.gg/hCbuZGwr2B 

Since the milestone reviewers stated their appreciation on server insights which we provided in Milestone 2, we continue to provide these insights. Here a screenshot video from the Mesh Discord server insights:

We hope this makes it easy for you to check for accountability and auditability.

And that's it for November 2024.
We are overall very glad to see that we are able to continue to maintain our open source tech stack and also engage developers and collaborations with other cardano builder projects, the funds received from the maintenance is definitely a support and additional motivator to our cause in building a stronger ecosystem.
