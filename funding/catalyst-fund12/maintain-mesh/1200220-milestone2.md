# Milestone 2 Report



Hey there Milestone reviewers :)
Here we are again, reporting on the successful completion of our second Milestone covering MeshJS tech & community maintenance for October 2024. Our stated milestone outcomes and acceptance criteria has been stated as:

Monthly report on MeshJS github and Discord activities to proof the maintenance and activities of MeshJS. The report includes metrics such as:
- Number of active GitHub repositories on MeshJS GitHub
number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository
Monthly summary of GitHub repository activities:
Active Discord Server
- Number of active public channels on MeshJS Discord server.
- Number of private support channels ON MeshJS Discord server.

So, here the report on each item.

## MeshJS github repositories
At the date of October 2024, MeshJS host a total of 36 repositories on the MeshJS github from which currently 28 are public repositories while 8 repos are still under development and not open to public yet
- https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories.

This adds a new  repository to the previous month with 35 repositories.

## Number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository

At the date of september 2024, MeshJS hosts a total of 24 repositories under Apache 2.0 open source licences. You can find all open source repositories at the same link as above at:
- https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories 

Repository activities, September 2024
We look on the repositories which receive currently most attention on development:
- Github repository: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh 

Excluding merges, 7 authors have pushed 85 commits to main and 109 commits to all branches. On main, 281 files have changed and there have been 26,522 additions and 3,764 deletions.
- Github repository:https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-saas 

Excluding merges, 2 authors have pushed 3 commits to main and 3 commits to all branches. On main, 11 files have changed and there have been 68 additions and 16 deletions.
In addition, a lot of work has gone into the further development of a Cardano multisig platform, which source code is at the date of this report not yet published. However, development can be followed via a new features page which outlines the already implemented features:

https://multisig.meshjs.dev/features 

We also teamed up with other cardano builder projects to further enhance developments of the multisig platform and we created and submitted a proposal in collaboration with ClarityDAO and Fluidtokens for Project Catalyst Fund 13 to enable funds for additional developments.

## Active Discord Server, October 2024

Our MeshJS Discord server stays home to all kinds of developer communications and coordinations. At the time of writing, we host a total of:
Public Channels: 5

Private Channels: 16 (one addition to last month since the multisig topic got its own channel)

We also started to organise larger topics via private discord forums which allows to create multiple threads at each forum. A more effective way to coordinate effectively on dedicated and scoped discussions around a larger theme. The Forums are set as private and we add contributors by measure to each forum. (Similar to the private channels)
Private Forums: 8
Forum threads: 43

The most active public channel is the ask-team channel where we see very lively engagements from newcomers as well as well seasoned cardano veteran developers.
Yup, overall a very active Discord server which helps us greatly to manage a whole bunch of communications and coordinations across all MeshJS worksides.

To the previous note of a Milestone Reviewer, requesting access to the private Discord Channels.
From our side, we are sorry but that's something we can not offer to the Milestone reviewer since it would not match with our current methodology to add only contributors which are actively working on a specific project/topic to respective channels. We keep these channels private for good reasons as we want to keep channels strictly for team communications. 
However, here is a link to the public Public server insights provided by Discord, 
https://discord.com/developers/servers/907191435864977459/analytics/growth-activation?interval=3&start=2024-10-01&end=2024-10-31 

we also took a screenshot video from the Mesh Discord server insights and added time into a folder for you to access: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PcpEH9cOpNtUJMlSQLKYBYFfO74ut7H7?usp=sharing 

We hope this makes it easier for you to check for accountability and auditability.

We will also see if we can further improve on the Discord metric reporting at later milestones, since we respect and agree with the milestone reviewers need to have easy access to required information on the Mesh Discord.

And that's it for October.

We are overall very glad to see that we arrive well to maintain our open source tech stack and also engage developers and collaborations with other cardano builder projects, the funds received from the maintenance is definitely a support and additional motivator to our cause in building a stronger ecosystem.
