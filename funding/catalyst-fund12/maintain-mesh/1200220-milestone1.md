We also added a new repository for reporting on our Milestones at Project Catalyst at:
https://github.com/MeshJS/funding. This repo helps to provide a high amount of auditability and accountability on our proposal implementations. 

### Active Discord Server
Our MeshJS Discord server stays home to all kinds of developer communications and coordinations. At the time of writing, we host a total of:
- Public Channels: 5
- Private Channels: 15
We also started to organise larger topics via private discord forums which allows to create multiple threads at each forum. A more effective way to coordinate effectively on dedicated and scoped discussions around a larger theme. The Forums are set as private and we add contributors by measure to each forum. (Similar to the private channels)
- Private Forums: 8
- Forum threads: 43
- 
Yup, overall a very active Discord server which helps us greatly to manage a whole bunch of communications and coordinations across all MeshJS worksides.
