# Milestone Report

Hey there Milestone reviewers :)

Here we are again, the last time for this proposal, reporting on the successful completion of our fifth Milestone covering MeshJS tech & community maintenance for January 2025 and with that, finally completing the proposal right on time. 

Our stated milestone outcomes and acceptance criteria has been stated as:

- Monthly report on MeshJS github and Discord activities to prove the maintenance and activities of > MeshJS. The report includes metrics such as:
> Number of active GitHub repositories on MeshJS GitHub
> Number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository
- Monthly summary of GitHub repository activities:
- Active Discord Server
> Number of active public channels on MeshJS Discord server.
> Number of private support channels ON MeshJS Discord server.
- Final closeout report is publicly available
- Final closeout video is publicly available
So, here is the report on each item.

## MeshJS github repositories

At the date of January 31, 2025, MeshJS hosts a total of 38 repositories on the MeshJS github from which currently 28 are public repositories. 10 repos are still under development and not open to the public yet. You can find all Mesh github repositories under:

https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories.

No changes to previous month*

Number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository

At the date of January 31, 2025, MeshJS hosts a total of 22 repositories under Apache 2.0 open source licences. You can find all open source repositories at the same link as above at:

Repository activities, January 2025

@meshsdk/core https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh 

Our core repository and flagship, packed with a bunch of stuff for builders which gets constantly maintained and enhanced and which is widely known and used within the Cardano developer ecosystem.

@meshsdk/core development January 2025.

In January 2024, Excluding merges, 5 authors have pushed 46 commits to main and 60 commits to all branches. On main, 186 files have changed and there have been 6,190 additions and 2,874 deletions.

@meshsdk/core dependencies

On January 31, 2025, we have 591 repositories from Cardano builder projects that depend on @meshsdk/core, meaning that we have an increase of 32 new projects using mesh/core, compared to the previous 559 dependencies in December 2024. We are positively surprised with this number and we are proud that we reached that much success with the stack so far. Worth mentioning as well the kind and quality of projects which build on Mesh. We are honored to see well known projects and builders using our code. 

### Here a list of highlights which showcase some of the use of our code within the Cardano ecosystem;

- Aiken https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken 
> Leveraging mesh code to build a well known and used cardano smart contract platform 

- Intersect https://github.com/IntersectMBO/council-toolkit-app 
> Using our code to build an app for the Intersect council to be able to vote on governance actions

- Masumi https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-registry-service 
> Building a Registry Service which provides an easy-to-use service to query and filter the registry of agents and nodes

- Empowa https://github.com/empowa-io/ecosystem-marketplace-app 
> Benefits from our tech for their Ecosystem Marketplace App

- TokeoPay https://github.com/TokeoPay/CNT-Toke and Socius: https://github.com/socious-io/aiken-contracts
> Where mesh code helps the projects to write validators in the validators folder, and supporting functions in the lib folder using .ak as a file extension

- BlinkLabs https://github.com/blinklabs-io/cf-cardano-ibc-incubator 
> Where mesh code helps Blinklabs to develop a bridge implementation to allow exchange of information from a Cardano blockchain to Cosmos SDK based blockchains

### Some special Announcements

Announcing that Mesh SDK is now being powered by IOG cardano-sdk. Quite some time went into this work and we are glad having achieved this work and are confident that a lot of builders and projects will benefit.

Active Discord Server, January 2025

Our MeshJS Discord server stays home to all kinds of developer communications and coordinations. In Q4 2024 we did first tries with using Discord ‘Forums’ instead of previously used channels and threads. Since we recognised the advantages of discord forums, we finally switched the previous channel to support developers on ”ask-team” channel into a ”ask-team” Forum which has been quickly established as the new and improved communication hub to provide quick support and guidance for developers.

On January 31, 2024 we have already 72 discussions on the ”ask-team” Forum, meaning we have a healthy increase compared to the 37 discussions at the previous month, showing us that the change from Channels to Forums in Q4 last year has been well adapted by our builder community. 

Other numbers

Public Channels & Forums: 6

Private Channels: 28

Since the milestone reviewers stated their appreciation on server insights which we started to provide in Milestone 2, we continue to provide these insights. Here a screenshot video from the Mesh Discord server insights:

## Close out Report

Since this milestone officially marks the completion of the Proposal, here is the detailed Close Out Report which is set as obligatory requirement for Funded Proposers in order to close a Proposal and where we reflect and summarise the overall Proposal.

## Close out Video

And for sure, a short video on our Youtube Channel where we outline and present the successful completion and journey of the proposal.

## Else

Maintain Mesh proposals continuation

We are really glad that the follow up proposal to this one, at Catalyst Fund 13 has been successfully approved by voters again which will help us to continue the success story of Mesh as a strong contributor to the Cardano Open Source developer ecosystem. We will continue to deliver and improve our work.

Note*

Since more granular funding environments start to emerge in Cardano, we aim to move Mesh-Maintain proposals and funding from Catalyst to the annual Cardano Budgets facilitated via Intersect, since we believe to have a better match in sustaining mesh open source via the annual core infrastructure budget. We submitted a proposal at Intersect, if approved, maintenance will switch after completing the F13 proposal to 

Proposal Reporting - Learn and Improve

Since we also want to further improve on our reporting as a funded proposer, we would highly appreciate your suggestions as Milestone Reviewers on your thoughts and ideas on how we can generally improve our reporting on the Maintain-Mesh proposals. We set up a simple form where we invite you to share your suggestions with us. The form does not require or track email/account information since we respect Milestone Reviewers anonymity. Might be a better way than to use the reviews or discussion section.

And that's it.

We hope all acceptance criteria are met
