# Milestone 4 Report
https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200220 

Hey there Milestone reviewers :)
Here we are again, reporting on the successful completion of our third Milestone covering MeshJS tech & community maintenance for December 2024. Our stated milestone outcomes and acceptance criteria has been stated as:
- Monthly report on MeshJS github and Discord activities to prove the maintenance and activities of > MeshJS. The report includes metrics such as:
> - Number of active GitHub repositories on MeshJS GitHub
> - Number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository
>> - [Number of] of authors have pushed [Number of] commits to main and [Number of] commits to all branches. On main, [Number of] files have changed and there have been [Number of] additions and [Number of] deletions
> Monthly summary of GitHub repository activities:
- Active Discord Server
> - Number of active public channels on MeshJS Discord server.
> - Number of private support channels ON MeshJS Discord server.

So, here is the report on each item.

## MeshJS github repositories
At the date of December 31, 2024, MeshJS hosts a total of 38 repositories on the MeshJS github from which currently 28 are public repositories. 10 repos are still under development and not open to public yet. You can find all Mesh github repositories under:
- https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/repositories.


## Number of active open source licences on MeshJS repository
At the date of December 31, 2024, MeshJS hosts a total of 22 repositories under Apache 2.0 open source licences. You can find all open source repositories at the same link as above at:

## Repository activities, December 2024
We look on the repositories which receive currently most attention on development:
@meshsdk/core https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh 
Our core repository and flagship which gets currently enhanced and updated to Cardano protocol updates, incurring that the widely adapted stack stays up-to-date and easily usable for Cardano builders. 
We have  currently 559 repositories from Cardano builder projects that depend on @meshsdk/core and we are proud that we reached that much success with the stack, you can find all projects depending on @meshsdk/core at:
- https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents
  
### @meshsdk/core development December 2024.
In december 2024, excluding merges, 6 authors have pushed 103 commits to main and 129 commits to all branches. On main, 268 files have changed and there have been 8,826 additions and 4,365 deletions.

### @meshsdk/funding https://github.com/MeshJS/funding 
In addition to our journey as a funded proposer, we started to host proposal milestone overview and insights on a dedicated github repository. The goal with this repo is to make it easier for anyone to have direct insights on our progress at funded proposals at Project Catalyst. Give it a look and if you as Milestone Reviewer have any cool ideas or suggestions on how to improve our github milestone reporting, feel free to let us know.
Excluding merges, 2 authors have pushed 25 commits to main and 25 commits to all branches. On main, 8 files have changed and there have been 170 additions and 6 deletions.

> More on this topic and our ideas and ambitions to further improve the proposal overview and insights will come with the Final Milestone of this proposal*

## Active Discord Server, November 2024
Our MeshJS Discord server stays home to all kinds of developer communications and coordinations. In Q4 2024 we did first tries with using Discord ‘Forums’ instead of previously used channels and threads. Since we recognised the advantages of discord forums, we finally switched the previous channel to support developers on ”ask-team” channel into a ”ask-team” Forum which has been quickly established as the new and improved communication hub to provide quick support and guidance for developers.
On December 31, 2024 we have already 37 discussions on the ”ask-team” Forum, approving its success and we are glad that our developer community engages with the new Forum.
Other numbers
Public Channels & Forums: 6
Private Channels: 28
The link to our Discord server: https://discord.gg/hCbuZGwr2B 
Since the milestone reviewers stated their appreciation on server insights which we provided in Milestone 2, we continue to provide these insights. Here a screenshot video from the Mesh Discord server insights:

Seems that Mesh continues to keep its place in the top of most active open source projects at https://x.com/ProofOfCardano and we are glad and proud that our small team and community scores continuously at the top ranks. 
Voting results of Mesh proposals in Fund13 additionally gave us a strong motivation and feedback that our work is continued to be widely appreciated and 5 funded proposals in Catalyst Fund13 will give us all hands to do and to further add value to the growing Cardano ecosystem.
And that's it for December 2024.

We are overall very glad to see that we are able to continue to maintain our open source tech stack and also engage developers and collaborations with other cardano builder projects. The funds received from the maintenance is definitely a support and additional motivator to our cause in building a stronger Cardano ecosystem.
