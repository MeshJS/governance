## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them
Fund12 Cardano Open: Developers KPIs:
- Standardize, develop, support, or provide utilities for full stack solutions and integrated
development environments
- Create new libraries, SDKs, publicly available APIs, toolchains and frameworks
- Governance tooling
We addressed these KPIs by mainly two streams:
1) Maintain the well known and used Mesh open source core repository at
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh to ensure that our tooling is always updated and ready
for use to anyone building on Cardano
2) Maintain the Mesh Discord server to provide 24/7 support to developers who ask
questions and advice

## List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them
The Project KPIs have been standardised across all Milestones and focused on:
- Maintain and operate existing open source MeshJS code on MeshJS GitHub
Mesh main github: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh

- Maintain and operate the open Discord channel for develop support
Mesh Discord: https://discord.gg/hCbuZGwr2B
These KPIs have been addressed by constantly operating our github and discord platforms and
activities. Here more detailed numbers:

## Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)
Key objectives, matching to our project KPIs are well achieved.

1) Maintain and operate existing open source MeshJS code on MeshJS
GitHub
In total, Mesh authors pushed 394 commits to “main” and 481 commits to all branches.
On main, 1179 files have changed and there have been in total 75,437 additions and
25,637 deletions on our open source mesh core repository. Furthermore, at the time of
this report, there are 591 Cardano Projects and builders depending on our github
repository and a total of 24 contributors.
These numbers prove a healthy activity and maintenance of our main repository and
shows that a wide range of projects make good use of our open source stack. We also
so increased contribution to our open source repo, and what started initially with 2
people is now given into the hands of many great builders who do not only use, but also
actively contribute to our tech stack

2) Maintain and operate the open Discord channel for develop support
In total, we had 680 visits and 9150 sent messages on Mesh Discord from start to end of
the proposal which comes down to average 136 visitors and 1830 visitors per month.
Having tools and easy to use guides is great, however, developers often appreciate
direct contact and communication to figure specific challenges. Keeping our open
Discord server to constantly help folks on their builders journey adds quite some value to
our project and we are glad to observe that folks which we see us contacting a first time
to get support regularly come back and over time, some even join our mesh contributors.

Measuring the success of our open source stack, we can check at the projects using mesh.
- https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents
  
We are glad to see 591 dependents and some well known projects which benefit from our work.
Here a list of highlights which showcase some of the use of our code within the Cardano ecosystem;

- Aiken https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken
Leveraging mesh code to build a well known and used cardano smart contract platform

- Intersect https://github.com/IntersectMBO/council-toolkit-app
Using our code to build an app for the Intersect council to be able to vote on governance actions

- Masumi https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-registry-service
Building a Registry Service which provides an easy-to-use service to query and filter the registry of
agents and nodes

- Empowa https://github.com/empowa-io/ecosystem-marketplace-app
Benefits from our tech for their Ecosystem Marketplace App

- TokeoPay https://github.com/TokeoPay/CNT-Toke and Socius:
https://github.com/socious-io/aiken-contracts Where mesh code helps the projects to write validators
in the validators folder, and supporting functions in the lib folder using .ak as a file extension

- BlinkLabs https://github.com/blinklabs-io/cf-cardano-ibc-incubator
Where mesh code helps Blinklabs to develop a bridge implementation to allow exchange of
information from a Cardano blockchain to Cosmos SDK based blockchains

Some special achievement which wasn't forcefully targeted, however achieved:
Announcing that Mesh SDK is now being powered by IOG cardano-sdk. Quite some time went into
this work and we are glad having achieved this work and are confident that a lot of builders and
projects will benefit.

## Key learnings
The set of well maintained Open Source github repositories and open Discord channels are a
great way to
engage developers not only to use, but also to contribute to our work. We observe that over
time, newcomers become contributors, some even close friends who start to take ownership
and responsibility. This is exactly what we hope to achieve since we believe onboarding new
developers at the Cardano ecosystem is as important as to retain and further support them on
their builder journeys.

## Next steps for the product or service developed
We are really glad that the follow up proposal to this one, at Catalyst Fund 13 has been
successfully approved by voters again which will help us to continue the success story of Mesh
as a strong contributor to the Cardano Open Source developer ecosystem. We will continue to
deliver and improve our work, making sure that our code stays always updated and ready for
use to anyone using our tools to build great projects on Cardano
Since we develop more granular funding environments in Cardano, we aim to move
Mesh-Maintain proposals and funding from Catalyst to the annual Cardano Budgets facilitated
via Intersect this year since we believe to have a better match in sustaining mesh open source

via the annual core infrastructure budget. We submitted a proposal at Intersect, if approved,
mesh maintenance will switch after completing the F13 proposal to Intersect.

## Final thoughts/comments
Funding from the treasury really does help in creating a strong motivation and discipline in
providing open source tooling for the developer ecosystem since the recognition of our work via
treasury resources shows and proofs us that our work is relevant and appreciated. As we don't
want to put our work behind paywalls it is indeed a challenge to explore how such work can be
sustained and maintained and always keep it updated and freely accessible to the community, a
challenge we share with many other open source builder projects in the space. Treasury funding
allows to retain and incentivise such efforts, opening a new door on how open source tooling
can be effectively maintained.
