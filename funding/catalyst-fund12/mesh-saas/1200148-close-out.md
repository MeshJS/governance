## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The Challenge KPIs of the Fund 12 “Cardano Use Cases: Concept“ Challenge have been stated as:

> “Use cases deliver adoption and real world utility of Cardano to a global base of users and customers. Use cases can be in the nature of applications, products, and new services that lay the foundations for innovative business ideas to flourish on Cardano.”

We addressed these KPIs by bootstrapping Mesh as a Service, through which we provide hosted server instances for wallet and transactions builder by restful APIs, this allows integration and interaction to Cardano blockchain from any technology stacks and systems.

## List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

The Project KPIs have been outlined and addressed via the proposal milestones. The milestone deliverables had been stated, addressed and successfully completed as:

### Fully deployed cloud infrastructure

This deliverable shows functional implementation of a core feature, demonstrating the utility of the concept and enabling technical validation through prototype interactions.

### Licence cloud infrastructure under an open source license on MeshJS github

Open-sourcing the infrastructure enhances transparency and invites community validation, encouraging feedback and reuse.

### Finalised Server application code - exposing the json to transaction endpoint & Mesh utils

Providing reusable utility functions coming from deeper product design thinking and supports validation by offering developers modular tools that can be tested and evaluated independently.

### Finalised Server application code - user-defined transaction building

This feature reflects a novel and flexible interaction model, demonstrating innovative potential. It validates the concept by enabling user input and experimentation with transaction structures.

### Finalised Server application code - hosted wallet / private key for signing

A hosted signing solution simulates a critical component of the full system. Testing it during the concept phase reveals key security, usability, and design trade-offs necessary before full implementation.

**Public URL on MeshJS Github:** https://github.com/MeshJS  
Public hosting on GitHub allows for peer review, collaboration, and feedback, fulfilling the requirement for community-visible validation of the prototype or concept.

**Code licensed under open source licence on MeshJS GitHub**  
Licensing under open source formalizes the commitment to transparency and reusability, supporting the wider Cardano ecosystem and reinforcing the originality and community engagement KPIs.

## Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

- Delivered an end-to-end functional prototype of Mesh SaaS, demonstrating real-world utility by allowing any technology stack to integrate with the Cardano blockchain through RESTful APIs for transaction building and wallet operations.
- Established a baseline infrastructure for Mesh as a Service that can serve as a launchpad for future enterprise-facing tools, lowering the barrier to Cardano integration for developers outside the Haskell/Plutus niche.
- Developed reusable modules like Mesh Utils and JSON transaction endpoints, encouraging adoption by providing composable, modular tools that are useful across a range of Cardano-based applications.
- Released all infrastructure and server application code under an open-source license, fostering community trust, transparency, and the potential for broader collaboration in the Cardano developer ecosystem.

## Key learnings

Mesh always had its main focus on building high quality tools for developers, this proposal was a first initiative which helped us to expand our offers and to target not only developers but also businesses and company focused solutions, a perfect example of valuable concept stage initiatives.

While Mesh SaaS definitely brings valuable solutions to companies and businesses, the concept of SaaS however does not seem to be the most impactful solution. Our work on the Mesh SaaS anyways, was a really important exercise for us which helped us to give more attention and brainpower to explore more effective and innovative solutions to provide high quality solutions for businesses and companies.

Our key learnings from this proposal eventually led to a whole new venture within mesh where we started to build upon our initial ideas and level up concepts towards effective and innovative solutions which are reflected via our new Web3 Services.

## Next steps for the product or service developed

While we learned a lot of useful lessons from building a Mesh SaaS, we also got some new ambitious ideas which are currently fed into a Mesh Web3 services, which we see as a natural evolution to the Mesh SaaS with the goal to package and bundle large parts of our tech stack into solutions tailored for businesses and enterprises.

We see the exploration and establishment of venue generating products and services as a top priority since it allows us to establish additional income streams and reduces our need for continuous funding from the Treasury.  
The initial efforts from this proposal eventually led to quite a few efforts from our side to explore further solutions for businesses which we started without requesting any funds via proposals, such as Mesh Web3 services:

## Final thoughts/comments

We are deeply grateful for everyone who supported this project, from Voters to Reviewers, Developers to Users and we thank Project Catalyst for providing a place where committed builders can access resources to build up their projects via direct community support.

For us, its a great deal to work on projects which are built and decided upon from the Cardano community and as a project which received strong support from voters at Catalyst in the past, we are definitely committed in keep building on Cardano.

The funding from this proposal also helps us in a great way to reward our contributors and to build a strong developer community at Mesh which combines awesome builders with awesome tools and adding quite some value to the Cardano Ecosystem.

As for the future, you can expect us to further work on effective solutions for businesses and companies and to further grow the Cardano Ecosystem.
