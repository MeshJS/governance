All Proposal outputs will be fully open sourced, useful for anyone who is building applications or learning how Cardano works.

[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution
We aim to enhance the Cardano developer ecosystem by providing robust, user-friendly, and interoperable development tools and resources for the Cardano developer ecosystem. 

Through the implementation of CIP-45 integrations, the development of a new Mesh Wallet, the creation of a modular Cardano Serialization Library (CSL), and the improvement of developer tools, we want to lower barriers to entry and to improve usability.

Each milestone is designed to build upon the previous, ensuring a cumulative enhancement of the developer experience. By improving technical infrastructure and community engagement, the proposal will ideally not only serve the existing Cardano developer ecosystem.but also attract and support new developers who come to build on Cardano.

[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community
This project will help to enhance the Cardano ecosystem by introducing needed development tools and resources, improving interoperability, and lowering barriers to entry for developers

Boost Developer Efficiency: Simplified processes and enhanced tools will reduce development time and frustrations, attracting more developers to build innovative solutions on Cardano.
Enhance Community Collaboration: Open-source contributions and comprehensive documentation will foster a transparent and inclusive community environment, encouraging ongoing engagement and innovation.
Drive Ecosystem Growth: With improved resources at their disposal, developers can create more robust applications, thus accelerating the growth and scalability of the Cardano platform.
[CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?
Trust and accountability:

MeshJS is one of the open source libraries with highest quality in the Cardano ecosystem. Our previous work is the best and most sincere argument to showcase that we have been constantly delivering our promises since inception.

Feasibility:

MeshJS team has inside out knowledge on Cardano and software development in all domains of Cardano DApp development. We understand what users and developers need and have a strong track record which undermines our competency in the field
