### List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them
Fund12 Cardano Open: Developers KPIs:
- Standardize, develop, support, or provide utilities for full stack solutions and integrated
development environments
- Create new libraries, SDKs, publicly available APIs, toolchains and frameworks
- Governance tooling
We addressed these KPIs by mainly two streams:
1. Standardizing, Developing, and Supporting Full-Stack Solutions & Tooling
- Integrated CIP 45 to standardize transaction metadata handling in dApps.
- Developed Meerkat and Yaci support, making dApp and wallet interactions more reliable.
- Finalized Mesh Wallet API, ensuring comprehensive wallet management.
- Created the Modular CSL library, improving code maintainability and reusability.
- Improved error handling to make debugging easier for developers.
- Provided dApp peer module, simplifying peer-to-peer transaction metadata exchange.

2. Creating New Libraries, SDKs, APIs, and Frameworks
- Released the CSL library as a modular package, making it easy for developers to
integrate and extend.
- Implemented dependency injection patterns to enhance modularity.
- Open-sourced all developments, making the codebase publicly available for contribution.
- Developed comprehensive documentation for Mesh Wallet and CSL.
All together, should make a humble deal to ease developer efforts, providing a more smooth and
effective developer experience.

### List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them
Our Project KPIs have been stated as:
- Boost Developer Efficiency: Simplified processes and enhanced tools will reduce
development time and frustrations, attracting more developers to build innovative
solutions on Cardano.
- Enhance Community Collaboration: Open-source contributions and comprehensive
documentation will foster a transparent and inclusive community environment,
encouraging ongoing engagement and innovation.
- Drive Ecosystem Growth: With improved resources at their disposal, developers can
create more robust applications, thus accelerating the growth and scalability of the
Cardano platform.
#### And here, how we addressed these KPIs:
Boost Developer Efficiency:
- Simplified transaction handling via CIP 45 integration, reducing development overhead.
- Modularized CSL logic, enabling easier customization and faster integration.
- Provided error-handling improvements, making debugging and troubleshooting more
straightforward.
- Developed clear documentation to minimize learning curves and onboarding time.
Enhance Community Collaboration:
- Open-sourced all developments on GitHub, encouraging contributions and transparency
as well as open and free use to anyone.
- Standardized wallet and dApp interactions, reducing fragmentation across projects.
- Created detailed guides and documentation, ensuring accessibility for both newcomers
and experienced developers.

Drive Ecosystem Growth:
- Built developer-friendly tooling, enabling the creation of more innovative applications on
Cardano.
- Strengthened full-stack development capabilities, allowing for more complex and
feature-rich dApps.
- Provided tooling that supports scalability and sustainability, ensuring long-term adoption.

### Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)
- Maintaining and further enhancing strong collaboration with the Cardano developer
community, ensuring MeshJS aligns with the needs of real-world dApp builders.

- Integrated community feedback throughout the project, refining features based on real
use cases and developer pain points.

- Developed comprehensive documentation, making onboarding easier and lowering
the barrier to entry for new developers.

- Supported engagement through GitHub discussions, Discord, and
developer-focused content, fostering an active and growing ecosystem.

- Enabled interoperability with existing dApp infrastructure through CIP 45 and modular
CSL components, increasing adoption potential across the Cardano ecosystem.
Also measurable via contributors at the core mesh github repository where we see
healthy engagements and are currently at 24 individuals who contributed to the open
source stack:

As well as the measurable use case of more than 600 projects using our code for their
their own projects on Cardano
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/network/dependents

### Key learnings

- Standardization is critical – Aligning with CIP 45 ensures that MeshJS remains
compatible with the evolving Cardano ecosystem.

- Modularity improves adoption – Developers appreciate flexible, modular solutions that
don’t force them into rigid architectures.

- Comprehensive documentation is a must – Well-documented tools see significantly
higher adoption and engagement.

- Open-source collaboration drives innovation – Community contributions help us to
constantly refine our implementations and bring fresh perspectives.

### Next steps for the product or service developed
As of next steps, there are no particular goals other than keeping mesh always updated and
enhanced to ecosystem evolutions making sure that new features which enrich the mesh stack
are always ready and easy for anyone who wants to build on the Cardano ecosystem.
Final thoughts/comments
Summarising the proposal, it has been a pretty smooth journey, from initially drafting and
submitting the proposal to being approved by vote, passing the onboarding process and
executing on the proposal milestones, everything went quite smoothly and shows that Catalyst
as whole is well maturing.
Also thanks and shoutout to the Milestone Reviewers of this proposal who did a great job in
assessing our Milestones.
