# Milestone 3 Report

Hey there Milestone reviewers, voters and everyone following our proposal progress.
Our devs shipping some extra hours to bring our proposal on track since we got slightly in delay with our planned deliverables for November 2023. 
We are glad to have catched up, and we are just finished to complete all deliverables of Milestone 3.

The Acceptance criteria had been stated as:
- Finalised Modular CSL lib: Creating interface for current CSL logic and prepare all necessary functions in CSL package
- Finalised Improve error messages
- Finalised Mesh Wallet: Yaci support development
- Finalised Mesh <> CIP 45 Documentation
- All code licensed under open source licenses on the MeshJS github

And here, our evidence of the successfuly completed work.

## Finalised Modular CSL lib: Creating interface for current CSL logic and prepare all necessary functions in CSL package

In order to enable support for modular serialization libraries, we implemented [IMeshTxSerializer](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-common/src/interfaces/serializer.ts), which is a common interface for all serialization libraries.

Then, we implemented [CSLSerializer](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-core-csl/src/core/serializer.ts) which contains all the necessary serialization functions to use the CSL library.

In the same way, we implemented [CardanoSDKSerializer](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-core-cst/src/serializer/index.ts), which interface with cardano-sdk library.

## Finalised Improve error messages

Previously, parsing WasmError was incorrect.

In order to improve error messages, we introduced a new type called `WasmResult, which turns the error into a JS object on WASM. Doing so allows us to get error messages from Rust libraries.

See [source code](https://github.com/sidan-lab/whisky/blob/91fe72d50243bfbf07030cfdc3ac5950c6c21a5e/packages/sidan-csl-rs/src/wasm/txbuilder.rs#L36).

## Finalised Mesh Wallet: Yaci support development

MeshWallet was designed to ["implements" `IWallet`](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-wallet/src/mesh/index.ts#L86), which is the same how [BrowserWallet](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/mesh-wallet/src/browser/index.ts#L53) was implemented.

This means it contains every endpoints needed to support Yaci development.

## Finalised Mesh <> CIP 45 Documentation

Documentation source code is [available at this link](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/apps/playground/src/pages/react/ui-components/connect-wallet.tsx#L128), which can be viewed live on our [Mesh website](https://meshjs.dev/react/ui-components#connectWallet).
