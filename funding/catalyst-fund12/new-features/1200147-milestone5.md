# Milestone 5 Report
Hey there Milestone reviewers, builders and anyone who is following our proposal progress.

Here the successful deliverables from the fifth and final Milestone with which we complete and close the proposal.

### Achievements & Development Progress
At the first milestone, we integrated CIP 45, enabling seamless transaction metadata creation that aligns with Cardano standards. Alongside, the Meerkat support implementation ensured compatibility with established dApp infrastructure. To enhance user interactions, we developed browser wallet endpoints that streamline dApp-to-wallet communication. Another key step was the early-stage development of Yaci support for more flexible backend wallet operations.

Enabled:

CIP 45 Integration & Meerkat Support: Makes it easier for devs to create transaction metadata that aligns with Cardano standards.

- Browser Wallet Endpoints: Enables seamless dApp-to-wallet communication, making user interactions smoother.
- Yaci Support (Initial Development): A step toward more flexible backend options for wallet operations.

The second milestone focused on expanding capabilities. A major highlight was the development of the dApp peer module for CIP 45, which allows developers to integrate peer-to-peer interactions without having to build custom solutions. We also finalized all wallet endpoints, making Mesh Wallet more reliable and complete. Yaci support saw further progress, enhancing its role as an alternative backend solution for wallet interactions.

Enabled:

dApp Peer Module for CIP 45: Lets developers integrate peer-to-peer interactions without reinventing the wheel.

- Finalized Wallet Endpoints: More complete and stable wallet interaction API.
- Yaci Integration Progress: Expanding backend support beyond traditional solutions.

The third milestone focuses toward modularization and stability. A significant step was the creation of a modular CSL library, which provides a structured interface for handling CSL logic without unnecessary dependencies. This modularity makes it easier for developers to integrate and customize functionality. Another major improvement was refining error handling, making debugging a much smoother experience. Yaci integration continued to mature, and the CIP 45 documentation was published, making it easier for developers to adopt these features.

Enabled:

Modular CSL Library: Allows devs to plug in CSL logic where needed without unnecessary dependencies.

- Improved Error Messages: Debugging is now less painful, giving clearer feedback when things go wrong.
- Yaci Integration Refinements: More stability and usability improvements.
- CIP 45 Documentation: Guides for getting started quickly.

The fourth milestone brought everything together. The modular CSL library underwent a dependency injection refactor, making it cleaner and more maintainable. Yaci support reached full implementation, ensuring that developers could confidently integrate it into their dApps. To complete the work, extensive documentation was written for both Mesh Wallet and the CSL library, ensuring that developers have clear guidance on how to use the newly developed features. As with all previous milestones, the code was made publicly available under open-source licenses on our github.

Enabled:

Dependency Injection for CSL: A cleaner, scalable approach for managing CSL logic.

- Finalized Yaci Support: Ready for production use.
- Comprehensive Documentation: Everything you need to integrate Mesh Wallet and CSL into your dApps.
- Fully Open-Sourced: Everything licensed for community use on the MeshJS GitHub.
- https://github.com/MeshJS/funding/blob/main/catalyst-fund12/new-features/milestone4.md  

The fifth Milestone finally focuses on summarising and wrapping up everything done and to create a detailed summary with this report, as well as providing the official close out report and video. Furthermore, a survey has been launched and shared with developers to provide feedback which will help us to further improve our tooling for the Cardano developer ecosystem. In addition, a simple twitter thread has been shared to share the proposal completion on Twitter (X).

### Survey
The survey is created and launched, the feedback will help us to receive feedback and to further improve based on user experience.
