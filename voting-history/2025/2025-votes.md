| Proposal Title | [Set 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA, 2026 Net Change Limit of 250M ADA](https://adastat.net/governances/7f320409d9998712ff3a3cdf0c9439e1543f236a3d746766f78f1fdbe1e06bf800) |
| Hash           | 7f320409d9998712ff3a3cdf0c9439e1543f236a3d746766f78f1fdbe1e06bf800 |

| Type           | InfoAction |
| Proposed Epoch | 546 |
| Expires Epoch  | 553 |
| Vote           | ❌No |
| Vote Submitted | 4/16/2025 |
| Rationale       | We see the alternative '2025 Net-Change-Limit' (gov_action1nd3t833j7v5sz65k3tp9yyvztw60sjcjgcgjr37682s3m7frwrusqmd2k80) proposal as a more robust and clear proposal, since it focuses on 2025 solely instead of 2025+2026, we vote NO on this proposal and YES on the alternative. We see the NCL of 350M Ada for 2025 as a relatively high, yet acceptable metric which is likely to cover all most relevant funding to core operations within the Cardano Ecosystem |

| Rationale       | We see the NCL of 350M Ada for 2025 as a relatively high, yet acceptable metric which is likely to cover all most relevant funding to core operations within the Cardano Ecosystem. Good enough to agree with. Lets then make sure that we effectively allocate budgets up to 350m ADA in 2025 and not waste funds with projects no one needs. |

| Proposal Title | [Defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and beyond](https://adastat.net/governances/56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc63600) |

| Type           | InfoAction |
| Proposed Epoch | 542 |
| Expires Epoch  | 549 |
| Vote           | ✅Yes |
| Vote Submitted | 3/11/2025 |
| Rationale       | We see the proposed roadmap for 2025 as a helpful effort in building ecosystem wide alignment on top priorities, and vote Yes on this proposal. We also hope that this proposal will encourage other efforts which aim to propose further roadmaps for the Cardano ecosystem. Since we achieved the last of the initial Cardano Milestones with Voltaire, we think that longterm roadmaps at Cardano have proven their worth and value and are a existential part of our culture and careful longterm thinking |

| Proposal Title | [Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%](https://adastat.net/governances/941502b0aa104c850d197923259444d2b57cab7af18b63143775465aaacc84f500) |

| Action ID      | gov_action1js2s9v92zpxg2rge0y3jt9zy626he2m67x9kx9phw4r942kvsn6sqfym0d7 |
| Type           | ParameterChange |
| Proposed Epoch | 539 |
| Expires Epoch  | 546 |
| Vote           | ❌No |
| Vote Submitted | 2/22/2025 |
| Rationale       | While we generally agree to reduce treasury spending and think that reducing the allocation to the Treasury is a effective way to achieve lower spending capacities, we yet see that we lack research on how such changes will impact the SPO ecosystem and deem that we currently should not change treasury income before we have better insights |

| Proposal Title | [Cardano Constitution to Replace the Interim Constitution](https://adastat.net/governances/8c653ee5c9800e6d31e79b5a7f7d4400c81d44717ad4db633dc18d4c07e4a4fd00) |

| Proposed Epoch | 537 |
| Expires Epoch  | 544 |
| Vote           | ✅Yes |
| Vote Submitted | 2/10/2025 |
| Rationale       | We see the proposed Constitution as a major improvement to the currently active interim Constitution and feel confident that emerging governance infrastructure and capacities are in place and growing to build and act upon the new Constitution. However, while we respect the significant community engagement and involvement which has led to major improvements, we still see room for improvements at the proposed constitution and hope that further evolutions lead of a constantly evolving constitution which is able to reflect and support rapid ecosystem growth and changes |
