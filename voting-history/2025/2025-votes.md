| Vote Submitted | 6/1/2025 |
| Rationale       | Members of the Mesh DRep have voted as following on the governace action: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect: Yes: 3 votes No: 4 votes Abstain: 0 votes Therefore, we will not support the proposal in its current form. Rationale: budget request, since we voted Yes on the NCL 200M Ada, this proposal exceeds the budgets we seem as appropriate for Treasury spendings in 2025, keeping in mind that we are already half-way through the year. Furthermore, we do have doubts of the need of a funding administrator as outlined in the proposal, which itself consumes already several million Ada. Furthermore, even if we may support a large part of the proposals within the package, we identify several budget allocation within the package as highly concerning and dont feel confident to give it a lumb yes vote. We would prefer a more granular approach which allows voters to decide onchain on each proposal and not only on the whole package as one. feasible deliverables, Due to the massive package, including a wide range of proposals as well as a funding administrator from which we saw in the past that many efforts have not been managed as effectively as we would like to, we see large risks in the successful delivery of the proposal. The produced overhead likely introduces many non-essential burocratic processes which will consume time and resources which could be better spend otherwise and which actually introduces many risks since the process introduces a single point of failure with a central funding administrator on which all proposals have to rely on. The new onchain governance system, in our perspective, was set to exactly avoid such single points of failures. Ecosystem value, Summarising all notes already mentioned, we see a high risk in the successful execution of the proposal and therefore have to doubt the value provided to the ecosystem. Team, Many proposals included in the package have awesome teams with highest skill sets and experience, however, this does not account for all proposals, either does it apply to the funding administrator. Lets be clear, we appreciate Intersect and its effort, yet the past has shown that many efforts at Intersect have not been able to stand up and match with the communities expectations. We surely believe that intersect has its place at the ecosystem, and while Intersect matures and gains experience and expertise, we still think that Intersect at its current stage has a high risk on being a effective administrator of such a large budget and scope. Recommendation. Learn from Project Catalyst, start small, build experience and expertise step by step and increase scope and budgets over time to ensure that the actual capacities to effectively manage such large operations are battle proofed and well matured.

| Vote Submitted | 5/13/2025 |
| Rationale       | Members of the Mesh DRep have voted as following on the 2025 Cardano NCL Yes: 4 votes No: 0 votes Abstain: 3 votes When it comes to Cardano Treasury spendings, with Mesh we are surely more on the conservative side. We see the first year of Cardano onchain governance and its treasury spendings as a crucial year in which we'd do better to prioritise on how we spend treasury and making sure that spendings are effective and efficient, focusing on high quality spending rather then high quantity spending. Having a smaller NCL sends a clear message to the ecosystem to be careful and more strict in our budget allocations in 2025. Also worth to keep in mind that in 2025, we are in the periodically recurring bull year, from historical data we can expect a increase of Ada price, meaning that less Ada have to be spend. This is already the case since we see many budget proposals currently calculating their budget requests on 0.50 USD per Ada, yet the last time Ada was globally traded at 0.50 USD/Ada was in late 2024. Therefore, we support the NCL = 200M ADA. |

| Rationale       | We see the alternative '2025 Net-Change-Limit' (gov_action1nd3t833j7v5sz65k3tp9yyvztw60sjcjgcgjr37682s3m7frwrusqmd2k80) proposal as a more robust and clear proposal, since it focuses on 2025 solely instead of 2025+2026, we vote NO on this proposal and YES on the alternative. We see the NCL of 350M Ada for 2025 as a relatively high, yet acceptable metric which is likely to cover all most relevant funding to core operations within the Cardano Ecosystem |

Good enough to agree with. Lets then make sure that we effectively allocate budgets up to 350m ADA in 2025 and not waste funds with projects no one needs. |

We also hope that this proposal will encourage other efforts which aim to propose further roadmaps for the Cardano ecosystem. Since we achieved the last of the initial Cardano Milestones with Voltaire, we think that longterm roadmaps at Cardano have proven their worth and value and are a existential part of our culture and careful longterm thinking |

However, while we respect the significant community engagement and involvement which has led to major improvements, we still see room for improvements at the proposed constitution and hope that further evolutions lead of a constantly evolving constitution which is able to reflect and support rapid ecosystem growth and changes |
