# Mesh Bounty Board
Welcome at Mesh Bounty Board, where we host bounties

## What Are Mesh Bounties?
Mesh bounties are open tasks posted to the community. Anyone who sees a match between their skill set and a bounty requirements can request ownership and complete the work. Our bounties will ideally cover a broad range of areas—primarily coding and development, but also educational materials, tutorials, videos and whatever we come up with.

## Rewards
All bounties are incentivized in ADA:
> ADA: The primary currency of Cardano, offered as financial compensation for successfully completing bounties.

## Why Does Mesh Host Bounties?
While the Mesh core team is dedicated to building on Cardano, we’re a relatively small group and well, we often face the limits of what we can do by our own. Yet, we see some good potential in inviting skilled community members to engage in tasks wich help up building Mesh.  

## By hosting bounties, we aim to:

- Distribute workload among community contributors and the core team.
- Propose easy gig-based tasks for Mesh community (anyone hanging around on our github & discord).
- Building up some long-term relationships with skilled contributors.


## How to Get Started
All you need to work on bounties is:
